And contaminants like that in our&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;buildings,<br>
Our buildings are so well sealed&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;some highly occupied now,<br>
We must look anew as to search for the how.
</p><p>…to ventilate that is&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and minimise the spread,<br>
Of virus and bacteria so folk do not dread,<br>
To occupy buildings all the world over,<br>
And feel safe with high efficiency filtered outside air&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;moreover.   
</p><p>Most ventilation systems mix the air,<br>
It is called<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>mixed flow ventilation’ and used everywhere,<br>
It has been used in buildings for many years,<br>
But now if we continue will fulfil our greatest fears.
</p><p>A good idea is air from outside to enter a room from the floor,<br>
To rise up to the ceiling&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and what’s more,<br>
For this air to move away vertically from the breathing zone,<br>
And to be exhausted at high level&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;say through a dome.
</p><p>This ventilation system it has a name,<br>
It is called displacement ventilation and in the game,<br>
It is used now and then but hardly anywhere,<br>
We must reverse that now and use it almost everywhere.
</p><p>Research shows with the displacement effect, the contaminants reduce,<br>
From occupant to occupant and that is of much use,<br>
For keeping our buildings healthy and clean,<br>
Which is what we need&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;that is clear to be seen.
</p><p>For independent and published work if that is sought,<br>
Look no further than <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200680">royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.200680</a>,<br>
Of course there are others but this is a good start,<br>
In our determination for clean and healthy buildings to play their part.
</p><p>The manufacturers and suppliers of the products are well established and exist,<br>
Research laboratories also for bespoke air building simulation and tests,<br>
A major concern of course is the energy for cooling or heating 100% outside air,<br>
This is something we must solve to enable the use of these systems everywhere.
</p><p>Energy heat recovery products and design ingenuity has progressed so much it is clear,<br>
As much as 75% energy air recovered from exhausted air to atmosphere,<br>
So why not modify existing and design all systems like this as a task?<br>
It is a question that building designers and we all must now ask.
</p><p>The demand for requiring heating in many new buildings is less that it has ever been,<br>
Because of the high standards of insulation and the building tightness it can be seen…<br>
Energy hungry cooling is becoming the major requirement everywhere,<br>
It is now vital to absolutely minimise the energy required to refrigerate the air.
</p><p>Whilst analysing energy requirements for building&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;consider this thought,<br>
In most temperate countries cool air outside is mostly not used to cool buildings&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;as it ought,<br>
But often recirculated air is refrigerated instead&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you see.<br>
So colder air outside is mostly wasted for the use of free cooling energy.
</p><p>Hot climates without the benefit of cooling outside,<br>
Have the huge advantage of the sun for electricity which solar panels will provide,<br>
Cooling systems utilising this electricity are clearly the way to go,<br>
This needs thought, originality and ingenuity we all know.
</p><p>What we must be sure of is hot countries must not follow the norm,<br>
Innovative cooling techniques using less and less electricity would be the form,<br>
Absorption equipment requiring heating for regeneration and electricity both using the sun is one way to go.<br>
And there is a world competition for cooling equipment innovation&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;<a href="https://globalcoolingprize.org">globalcoolingprize.org</a>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;you must know.
</p><p>Shaded air inlets and water sprays are already used but not a lot,<br>
The correct application of displacement reduces size of cooling plant&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;more often than not.<br>
The net effect of this will be much lower energy use,<br>
Less maintenance costs as well so much to gain an nothing to lose.
</p><p>There are pluses; the deadly Covid epidemic paradoxically will assist…<br>
To make us think again now and for us to enlist…<br>
All our imaginations, to be inventive and prepared and more than that,<br>
For us all to work together and co-exist happily on this planet.
</p><p><span class="small-caps">PS
</span></p><p>But is there such a thing as specialist air distribution designers, (needed for each building) exist?&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp; well yes there are,<br>
They are essential to work with owners for optimum performance by far,<br>
The building team and owner must work closely together for the best solution,<br>
For clean and healthy buildings quite free from pollution and also contribute hugely to the green revolution.
