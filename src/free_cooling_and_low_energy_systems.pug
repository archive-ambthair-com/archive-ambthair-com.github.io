    | The discerning building owner would do well to take an
    | interest in how the environment in their building is achieved as
    | the choices at arriving at what may or may not be a satisfactory
    | environment to the HVAC engineer are legion and all too often and
    | regrettably have to be taken in isolation. The choices will
    | probably have to be lived with throughout the life of the
    | building and as well as being one of the highest annual outgoing
    | costs, further, the comfort of the building will probably be the
    | single most important issue to the occupier effecting both their
    | well being and health. The owners interest would empower the HVAC
    | designer who would explain the choices at the outset and would
    | explain the trade off costs of compromise that are often required
    | in the building design process and construction.
  p
    | Human comfort and low energy systems in buildings are not
    | necessarily a contradiction in terms, in fact it is a paradox
    | that low energy systems more often than not provide better
    | comfort. It is also a paradox that in buildings in cities
    | throughout the world, even in temperate climates, that vapour
    | compression equipment is providing cooling throughout the year
    | even though the external temperature for the vast majority of
    | time is lower than the internal building ambient temperature. Any
    | feedback about any of the information discussed in this article,
    | such as that by Mr Dahliwal and contained herein, would be most
    | appreciated by the writer as of course would be any other
    | feedback.
  p
    | As the article is intended for and warmly welcomes those who
    | may have no knowledge at all of the HVAC industry, the writer
    | apologises in advance for what may be regarded by others as
    | obvious or oversimplification.
  h3#introduction Introduction
  p
    | This article discusses practical methods of minimising the
    | effect in buildings of, in particular, internal heat gains which
    | have become more prevalent in recent years because of the
    | information technology industry etc. and also discusses the issue
    | of optimum comfort. The thrust of the article is less concerned
    | with rural buildings in temperate climates which even with quite
    | high internal heat gains may only overheat for a few weeks a year
    | but more concerned with urban buildings in temperate or hot
    | climates. In his excellent book 
    cite
      | &apos;Passive and Low Energy
      | Cooling of Buildings&rsquo;
    |  the author Professor Baruch Givoni
    | differentiates between with what he describes as &lsquo;tropical
    | bioclimate architecture&rsquo; and other methods of achieving cooling
    | in buildings.
  p
    | Tropical bioclimate architecture is more to do with mitigating
    | the effect of heat by the use of shading, colour, orientation of
    | building, size of windows and structure of building and its
    | effective application is essential in any hot climate and, of
    | course, many societies have practised and have become extremely
    | skilful in using this method of protecting themselves from hot
    | climates over many years. However this article is more related to
    | methods of introducing cooling to buildings by passive or active
    | ventilation or other means and of course it is assumed that these
    | methods should be used to augment effective tropical bioclimate
    | architectural techniques.
  p
    | An American called Jacob Perkins living in London in the U.K.
    | patented the first closed vapour compression refrigeration system
    | in 1884. The refrigerants used were generally flammable and/or
    | toxic and generally not very satisfactory. The dramatic and
    | acclaimed introduction of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 1930 in
    | the form of R12 at a meeting of the American Chemical Society
    | marked the beginning of modern refrigerants which would, in time,
    | revolutionise technology throughout the world.
  p
    | In 1974 Messrs. Rowland and Monila presented the hypothesis
    | that chlorofluorocarbons and other gases were damaging the
    | earth&rsquo;s atmosphere by the Greenhouse Effect which they claimed
    | increased the atmospheres ability to absorb infra-red radiation
    | therefore reducing the rate at which the planet is able to shed
    | energy into space and also by Ozone Depletion which stated that
    | gases accumulating in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere acted as a catalyst
    | to destroy ozone.
  h3#international
    | International Agreement and
    | Commitment and the Kyoto Protocol
  p
    | The international agreement reached at the Rio Earth Summit in
    | 1992 resulted in The Framework Convention on Climate Change and
    | placed commitments on developed countries to devise policies and
    | measures to bring down greenhouse gas emission to their 1990
    | levels by the year 2000 and also to provide financial assistance
    | to developing countries to meet their general commitments.
  p
    | Some countries will meet those targets but others will not.
    | Hence, international agreement was reached that the next step had
    | to involve a framework leading eventually to legally binding
    | targets. The world&rsquo;s industrialised nations signed the Kyoto
    | Protocol on the 11th December 1997 agreeing to a collective cut
    | in greenhouse gas emissions of 5.2% by 2008-2012. The emissions
    | targets have as yet no legal &lsquo;teeth&rsquo; although it is intended to
    | try and introduce legal enforceability at some stage, to date 176
    | countries have signed the agreement. The target will be achieved
    | by cuts of 8% by Switzerland, most Central and East European
    | states and the European Union, 7% by the US and 6% by Canada,
    | Hungary and Japan, the countries of Poland, Russia, New Zealand
    | and Ukraine are to stabilise their emissions, while Norway may
    | increase emissions by up to 1%, Australia by up to 8%, and
    | Iceland 10%.
  p
    | The European Union have agreed amongst themselves that
    | reductions will be:

  p
    | It was agreed the reduction in the three main greenhouse gases
    | of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane would be measured
    | against a baseline of 1990 emissions, whereas sulphur
    | hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons would be
    | set against a baseline of 1995 levels. The greenhouse gas target
    | is now expressed as the total national emissions over the period
    | of 2008 to 2012 to facilitate calculations of averages.
  p
    | Nations may meet these binding targets by joint
    | implementation, for instance a developed country may take credit
    | for funding greenhouse cuts in another country. The Protocol also
    | envisages developed countries trading greenhouse gas emissions
    | between themselves to the effect that a country that has
    | achieved, or even exceeded its own respective target could,
    | hypothetically, exchange with another country which is struggling
    | to achieve its respective target.
  p
    | The current position of HCFCs (of which R22 is the most
    | prevalent in air conditioning) in Europe is:
  ul
    li 35% cut by 2002
    li 60% by 2007
    li 80% by 2010
    li 95% by 2013
    li Phase out by 2015
  p The new draft is more radical and proposes the following:
  ul
    li 10% cut by 2002
    li 65% by 2003
    li 70% by 2004
    li 95% by 2008
    li Phase out by 2015
  p
    | From 2008 the use of virgin HCFCs shall be prohibited in the
    | maintenance and servicing of air conditioning equipment.
  p
    | The fourth convention on Climate Change will be held in
    | November in Buenos Aries and information on the Kyoto Protocol
    | may be found on the

    | .
  h3#emissions Emissions Trading and Permits
  p
    | What is most likely to affect both the building owner and the
    | building service engineer as a direct result of Kyoto, is the
    | prospect of Emission Permits. The US is the main proponent of
    | emissions trading, this based on its own successes with companies
    | for whom sulphur emissions were a concern. Permits were allocated
    | to companies for sulphur emissions; this allocation being
    | tradeable on the open market. The opening prices for Sulphur
    | Emissions Permits when first issued were high but rapidly fell,
    | it is thought, for the two following reasons. Firstly, abatement
    | projects became more economical when the cost per ton abated was
    | less than the market price of an Emissions Permit. Secondly,
    | companies began to revise their thinking about the cost of
    | abatement measures when they themselves needed to buy an
    | emissions permit.
  p
    | Similarly, it is supposed that building owners would have a
    | set of permits which cover green house gas emissions from their
    | buildings. The tradeable permit may perhaps only cost money at
    | the outset; very efficient companies may not need to have permits
    | or alternatively use them to their financial advantage by selling
    | them to other companies. What will be unfamiliar to all is that
    | the permit may well be a legal document in the future. Whereas it
    | has hitherto been considered by many countries in the past, that
    | the price of energy would have to become very high before
    | building owners took serious notice of energy efficient design,
    | the issuing of permits is likely to concentrate the building
    | owners mind a great deal more. Even if a permit system does not
    | embrace building owners other countries might devise a system
    | that does. One country for example may wish to release onto the
    | international emissions trading market the savings from replacing
    | the district heating schemes of entire cities.
  p
    | The Kyoto meeting set out an ambitious agenda to tackle global
    | climate change and it is intended much of the detail needed to
    | turn it into law will be negotiated at the Buenos Aires meeting
    | in November 1998. What is certain is that the building owners and
    | developing countries in particular would do well to address the
    | issue now and have nothing to lose by this but much to gain. For
    | building service engineers throughout the world the Kyoto
    | Protocol provides a demanding and yet exciting challenge ahead.

  h2.mt-5#freecooling Free Cooling and Low Energy Systems
  p
    | Free cooling take place when the external ambient air enthalpy
    | (the term used for a combination of sensible heat and moisture
    | content) is less than the indoor air enthalpy and the cool
    | external air is transferred to the building envelope either
    | directly or indirectly. Surprisingly this is not taken advantage
    | of very widely in most countries of the world and of course the
    | efficacy of the external cool air would be increased when used in
    | modern buildings because of improved insulation values.
  p
    | Free cooling may be used in conjunction with air systems and
    | hydraulic systems. This article discusses the use of free cooling
    | with air systems.
  p Air conditioning systems either provide supply air using
  ol(style='list-style: lower-alpha;')
    li A mixture of outside air and recirculated air, or
    li
      | 100% outside air systems which are generally used in the
      | cases of hospitals, densely occupied areas such as
      | theatres etc. or increasingly there is a preference for
      | these systems as a matter of course in certain countries.
  h3#mixed
    | Free Cooling using Mixed Outside Air and
    | Recirculation Systems and Temperature and Enthalpy Control
  p
    | Free cooling may be used with mixed outside air and
    | recirculation systems by the use of modulating dampers. Dampers
    | are provided on the outside air intake ductwork, exhaust air
    | ductwork and the recirculation ductwork. In the event of cool
    | outside air the quantity of outside air is increased and the
    | quantity of recirculated air is reduced to provide the required
    | supply air temperature. In this way cooling by means of
    | refrigeration equipment is avoided altogether at certain times of
    | year and often at night times.
  p
    | This system of free cooling is popular and uses thermostats to
    | determine when the outside air is cool and the proportion the
    | outside air damper should be opened by. More accurately the
    | proportion of outside air should be increased when the outside
    | air enthalpy is lower than the room enthalpy. In reality
    | temperature sensing is more popular because thermostats are less
    | costly and are less likely to drift out of calibration.
  p
    | When the outside air temperature (alternatively enthalpy) is
    | higher than the room temperature (alternatively enthalpy) in
    | Summer the dampers will modulate to the minimum outside air
    | position to keep the load on the refrigeration equipment to a
    | minimum.
  h4#additionalfreecooling
    | Additional Free Cooling using
    | Dew Point Control and Direct Humidifiers
  p
    | Further sensible cooling (reduction in temperature as
    | indicated on a thermometer) may be achieved by the use of
    | humidifiers which spray water into the air steam to cool the air.
    | This method of sensible cooling is extremely effective but became
    | less popular in the last decade or more because of Legionnaires&rsquo;
    | Disease. This form of cooling used to be provided by air washers
    | but the concern over Legionella meant that ultra-violet light and
    | other forms of biocide control had to be used in conjunction with
    | this equipment and added both capital costs and high maintenance
    | costs. In reality the industry turned to steam injection
    | humidifiers if humidification was required because there was no
    | risk at all with respect to Legionella. However steam injection
    | humidifiers do not provide any sensible cooling and in fact
    | provide a small amount of sensible heating and whilst they are
    | valuable tools for humidification are of no value for free
    | cooling.
  h4#legionnaires
    | Consideration of Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease
    | and Humidifiers
  p
    | Legionella Pneumophila is ubiquitous in water and only
    | believed to be a problem when growth and therefore colonisation
    | takes place. This tends to happen in stagnant water and the water
    | temperature is typically between 20&deg;C and 45&deg;C. To be ingested
    | into the respiratory system the water must be absorbed in an
    | aerosol form.
  p
    | Steam injection humidifiers became popular because all
    | bacteria were pasteurised although the benefit of sensible
    | cooling using spray coils was lost. Chemical biocides (bacteria
    | killing process) such as those that are chlorine and bromine
    | based are suitable for cooling towers, where sprays are also
    | used, but not suitable for supply air systems to occupied
    | buildings due to their toxicity. The options remaining were
    | therefore limited to biocides such as ultra-violet light (a
    | further possible option is the use of chlorine dioxide which is
    | soluble in water and claimed by the manufacturers to be harmless
    | when drunk).
  p
    | Some of the new generation of water humidifiers address the
    | problems brought about by the concern for Legionella Pneumophila
    | and also provide sensible cooling and may be used for dew point
    | control.
  dl
    dt Evaporative Humidifiers
    dd
      p
        | These humidifiers spray water on to a matrix and water is
        | transmitted to the air stream through the saturated
        | matrix or corrugation. Provided the air velocity through
        | the matrix is limited to 1.75 m/s then the air velocity
        | is sufficiently low to prevent aerosols forming and they
        | are thought to be safe to use without regular biocide
        | treatment. The sump is generally sufficiently cold to
        | prevent the colonisation of Legionella and when the sump
        | water is not being used i.e. stagnant then the water
        | should be drained from the sump.
    dt Ultra-sonic Humidifiers
    dd
      p
        | Ultra-sonic humidifiers use transducers (devices that use
        | input energy to create a different form of output energy)
        | vibrating at a high frequency in water to create fine
        | aerosols. Manufacturers claim the ultrasonic shock acts
        | as a biocide.
    dt Pneumatic Humidifiers
    dd
      p
        | These are generally connected directly to the water
        | supply and compressed air is used to propel water through
        | nozzles to create a fine aerosol. Close humidity control
        | may be achieved by these humidifiers.
  p
    | Of the three, the evaporative humidifier is likely to have the
    | lowest capital costs and may generally be used without biocides
    | for most applications.
  h4#dewpoint
    | The Application in Practice of Dew Point
    | Control and Direct Humidifiers
  p
    | The use of the humidifiers described above, known as adiabatic
    | (constant enthalpy or heat energy) humidifiers, have the effect
    | of a useful reduction in dry bulb temperature whilst increasing
    | the air moisture content thus making no difference to the
    | enthalpy of the air. The dew point of air is the temperature of
    | saturated air i.e. air at 100% relative humidity and the dew
    | point temperature of air at less than 100% relative humidity will
    | always be lower than the dry bulb temperature and in this way
    | therefore the saturation of air with water vapour lowers the dry
    | bulb temperature by means of the process know as adiabatic
    | cooling which by definition is at constant enthalpy at 0&deg;C feed
    | water temperature. In reality and perhaps surprisingly the feed
    | water temperature does not make a significant difference to the
    | process. With feed water as high as 100&deg;C the water is
    | evaporated more quickly; this will cause a slight gain in
    | enthalpy.
  p
    | This simple but effective method of lowering the dry bulb
    | temperature of the air has been practised for many years.
  p
    | In Summer when the outdoor air enthalpy is higher than the
    | indoor ambient enthalpy then the modulating dampers would
    | modulate to minimum outside air and the humidifier would not be
    | used.
  p
    | In Spring and Autumn when the outdoor enthalpy is lower than
    | the indoor enthalpy but is less than the required enthalpy for
    | sufficient indoor cooling, the dampers are modulated to the dew
    | point of the supply air and the humidifier saturates the air to
    | dew point. The air is then reheated if required to the supply air
    | temperature or may not require reheating if the condition of the
    | air after the humidifier is exactly as required to maintain room
    | conditions.
  p
    | In Winter, when the outside air enthalpy is low, then the
    | modulating dampers would modulate to minimum position to achieve
    | the required dew point and the air reheated after the
    | humidification process to achieve the required supply air
    | condition. In very cold weather a preheater may be required.
  p The sensors required to achieve the above control are:
  ol
    li
      | Enthalpy or dry bulb sensor in the incoming outside air
      | duct.
    li
      | Dew point sensor after the humidifier with the set point
      | at the required supply air moisture content.
    li
      | Dry bulb sensor after the reheater to control the
      | required re-heat.
    li
      | The set point of (3) may be scheduled against ambient
      | temperature or changes in response to the extract air
      | temperature by a dry bulb sensor in the return air duct.
  p
    | The method of control described is simple but is wasteful of
    | reheat because the intake air must be cooled to saturation point
    | to achieve the required dew point and then reheated to supply air
    | temperature. A more sophisticated control would be carried out
    | using a Building Energy Management System (BEMS system)
    | controlling both moisture content and enthalpy. As close humidity
    | control is required, a direct injection adiabatic humidifier
    | would normally be used with this form of control and installed
    | after the heating coil, in contrast to the control strategy
    | described previously when the humidifier would normally be
    | installed before the heating coil.
  p
    | This method of control performs a series of logical tests at
    | points around the system for values of enthalpy and moisture
    | content to arrive at the most efficient control strategy and in
    | this way reduces the amount of reheat required.
  p
    | When heating is required the dampers will modulate to the
    | required room moisture content and in this way reheat is reduced.
  p
    | When cooling is required the dampers will modulate to the
    | required room enthalpy and the air then adiabatically humidified
    | to the required room supply air temperature.
  p
    | For low enthalpy and moisture content conditions in Winter the
    | moisture content will not be in the range of the damper
    | modulation and in this event the air will require to be preheated
    | before humidification.

    | Outside Air Heat Recovery and Indirect
    | Evaporative Humidifiers
  p
    | A simple and yet effective way of providing free cooling is to
    | provide a heat recovery unit between the supply and exhaust duct
    | which is normal practice when using 100% outside air systems. An
    | evaporative humidifier (known as an indirect humidifier when
    | located in the return air duct) is then provided before the
    | exhaust connection to the heat recovery unit. Free cooling is
    | obtained whenever the external ambient temperature exceeds the
    | temperature in the exhaust duct after the evaporative humidifier.
    | This system has the advantage of sensible heat only being
    | transferred to the air stream and therefore moisture content is
    | not increased. When the external ambient temperature is lower
    | than the temperature after the evaporative humidifier then free
    | cooling would be provided from outside air and modulating dampers
    | used to allow the exhaust air to bypass the heat recovery unit.
    | This system is a low design risk option and although it will not
    | eliminate refrigeration entirely will considerably reduce the
    | size of plant required.

    p
      | Normally in India the DG houses were ventilated by using
      | axial flow fans and accepted norm was to accept indoor temp.
      | exceeding 50&deg;C because the air quantities required to
      | achieve lower temp become uneconomic. The mixed flow
      | ventilation often provided air at 12 ft from the ground
      | level. This arrangement caused the work level temp to be
      | still higher.
    p
      | With a combination of Indirect/Direct evaporative cooling

      | the floor level temp almost 7 to 8&deg;C below the ambient and
      | in addition the power saving have exceeded 75% when compared
      | with a mixed flow ventilation system capable of maintaining
      | temp above 7&deg;C above ambient.

  h3#desiccants Desiccants
  p
    | Evaporative humidification is an extremely useful technology
    | particularly in hot dry climates and may also be used to reduce
    | the load on air conditioning equipment in damper climates. The
    | limitation of evaporative humidifiers is that the reduction in
    | dry bulb temperature is conditional on the moisture content of
    | the incoming air and as a result the use of desiccant wheels have
    | become increasingly popular as they are able to increase the
    | efficiency of the adiabatic process by reducing the air moisture
    | content prior to humidification.
  p
    | The desiccant wheel dries the air and is usually used in
    | conjunction with a thermal wheel to transfer sensible heat from
    | the supply air duct. The system may not be considered as free
    | cooling as heat is required to regenerate the desiccants but may
    | be considered as low energy because in most climates evaporative
    | cooling is sufficient at certain times of year without the need
    | for drying by the desiccants.
  h3#soliddesiccant Solid Desiccant Systems
  p
    | Entering air to the system is dehumidified and heated by a
    | rotating desiccant wheel. The drier air then passes through a
    | sensible heat recovery wheel which reduces the dry bulb
    | temperature of the supply air without altering moisture content.
    | The dry bulb temperature of the air is reduced still further by
    | passing through an evaporative humidifier (called a direct
    | humidifier when installed in the supply duct) and in to the air
    | conditioned space. The evaporative humidifier increases the
    | moisture content of the air in proportion to reduction in dry
    | bulb temperature.
  p
    | Return air is generally passed through another evaporative
    | humidifier where the return air temperature is reduced and
    | moisture content increased. This colder air is transferred via
    | the sensible heat recovery wheel, previously mentioned to the
    | supply air duct. The return air temperature is then further
    | increased by passing through a heater and the air temperature
    | elevated to a level sufficient to reactivate the desiccants in
    | the desiccant wheel in the return air section of the duct.
  p
    | The use of heat for the regeneration process is the highest
    | energy requirement of the system. The elevated temperature of the
    | return air duct removes moisture from the desiccants and the
    | wheel will then absorb moisture again.
  p
    | Typical desiccant reactivation temperatures required in the
    | return air duct for Europe are 70-80&deg;C and air will be exhausted
    | from the system at typically 40-50&deg;C. A proportion of return air
    | may bypass the heater and desiccant wheel in order to minimise
    | energy consumption.
  p
    | Desiccant cooling is a potentially environmentally friendly
    | technology for cooling buildings particularly if solar energy is
    | used for the reactivation process. Research seems to indicate
    | that in Europe a hybrid system should be used to minimise
    | reactivation costs. This would consist of a desiccant ventilation
    | system cooling the incoming air and using solar/gas for
    | reactivation used in conjunction with low grade chilled water
    | from towers or better still purpose constructed ponds serving
    | ceiling chilled water coils providing sensible cooling and in
    | this way avoid vapour compression equipment altogether. It would
    | seem in a hot climate that it is possible that all of the cooling
    | could be provided by the desiccant system and solar energy and
    | this is likely to reduce capital costs, running costs and
    | maintenance costs considerably as well as avoid vapour
    | compression equipment.
  h3#liquiddesiccants Liquid Desiccants
  p
    | The desiccant system described previously uses solid
    | desiccants i.e. silica gel or lithium chloride; liquid desiccant
    | systems use a liquid spray of desiccant solution such as lithium
    | bromide. The development of liquid desiccant systems compared to
    | solid desiccant systems is still in its infancy although it is
    | claimed that liquid desiccant systems have the potential
    | advantage of better efficiency as dehumidification and heat
    | transfer take place simultaneously rather than sequentially.
  p
    | The Genius 4000 has been developed in the USA by Albers Air
    | Conditioning and uses liquid desiccants to dehumidify outside air
    | or cool make up air without the need for conventional
    | refrigerants. The liquid desiccant in this system is composed of
    | 90% lithium bromide and 10% lithium chloride. According to Albers
    | Air Conditioning, liquid desiccants do not deteriorate over time,
    | unlike solid desiccants. However, sulphur contaminants in the air
    | can combine with the desiccant to form lithium sulphate, which is
    | not a desiccant. Ablers claim that, as there are about 80 litres
    | in the machine, it would take a long time to reduce the desiccant
    | to a significant level. In dirty conditions Albers states that it
    | might prove necessary to change the desiccant as part of an
    | annual service, although the regeneration process tends to remove
    | most of the pollutants.
  p
    | Performance figures, taken from the manufacturer&rsquo;s tests at
    | outside conditions of 28&deg;C dry bulb and 50% relative humidity
    | give 37 KW of gross cooling, air being supplied to the room at
    | 11.4C. A room condition of 23&deg;C dry bulb and 55% relative
    | humidity was used in calculating the capacity and the cooling
    | capacity would increase at higher temperatures and humidities.
    | Primary energy use for the Genius is said to be typically 30%
    | less than conventional vapour compression equipment and
    | approximately halves the operating costs. The system would be
    | best suited for systems with high outside air requirements and
    | would have to be used in conjunction with other equipment for
    | high internal sensible loads although this may not necessarily be
    | the case if used in conjunction with a Termodeck (see later)
    | system which does much to mitigate the effect of high internal
    | sensible heat gains.
  h3#thermal
    | Thermal Energy Storage, Phase Change and
    | Eutectic Chemicals
  p
    | When using desiccants for cooling, as the reheat required for
    | the regeneration of the desiccants is by far the highest single
    | energy cost, it makes sense to mitigate these costs as far as
    | possible. Solar energy may be stored by the use of phase change
    | material which raise the melting point and boiling point of a
    | chemical solution using Eutectic salts. The thermal energy stored
    | is released back in to the system when required and in this way
    | provides free reheat at certain times.
  p
    | Thermal energy storage may be used for storing either cool
    | energy or heat energy and the appropriate phase change material
    | selected for the particular application. Many countries offer
    | cheap rate electricity costs at night to even electricity demand
    | and therefore cool energy may be stored at night for use the
    | following day with the resulting economy.
  h3#alternative
    | Alternative Methods of Cooling and
    | Reducing Cooling Loads and Energy Costs
  h4#night Night Cooling
  p
    | The use of a building as a heat sink to absorb heat in
    | occupied hours and then followed by night cooling has shown to be
    | beneficial.
  p
    | A much used technique is to have cool night air pass over a
    | slab and in this way cool the slab at night. The warmer daytime
    | air will be reduced in temperature when passing over the cooled
    | slab and help to reduce the daytime peak load. It is clear that
    | during hot weather it would probably always be helpful for night
    | time cooling to take place and the control strategy would be
    | simple. The control strategy to be used for quite hot days is
    | less obvious because the energy consumed by the running of a fan
    | at night as against the energy saved by slab cooling may be
    | marginal or counter-productive. In a predominantly hot climate
    | the strategy for night cooling would be reasonably simple but in
    | a temperate climate is less clear. On site tests carried out by
    | the Building Service Research Association in the UK have
    | suggested the following strategy:
  p
    | That night time cooling should be initiated if any or a
    | combination of the following occur:
  ul
    li Peak indoor zone temperature exceeds 23C
    li Average zone indoor temperature exceeds 22C
    li
      | Average afternoon outdoor temperature is higher than
      | 20C
  p
    | They also conclude that night time cooling should continue to
    | be used if all of the following criteria occur:
  ul
    li
      | The indoor zone temperature is higher than the outside
      | air temperature +2C
    li
      | The indoor zone temperature is higher than indoor heating
      | set point.
    li The outside air temperature is higher than 12C
  p
    | The night cooling would be carried out seven days a weeks
    | during the unoccupied periods of the building and once the
    | criteria are not satisfied then night cooling would continue to
    | operate for an additional two nights providing night cooling has
    | taken place for the previous five nights.
  p
    | A minimum set point should be provided to prevent overcooling
    | otherwise re-heating would be required and therefore be
    | counter-productive.
  p
    | When using a mechanically ventilated building for night
    | cooling then the exhaust fan should be preferred to avoid
    | temperature pick up from the supply fan (unless the supply fan
    | motor is out of the air stream) and a minimum air velocity of 1.5
    | m/s. It may even be worth considering the installation of a night
    | cooling bypass duct which would bypass the main plant to avoid
    | pressure drop and minimise fan energy; in order that less energy
    | is used then the fan would need to be a variable speed fan or at
    | least a two speed fan.
  p
    | There is a possibility in certain climates that the
    | temperature of the slab when cooled could cause condensation and
    | this should be safe guarded against by the use of a moisture
    | detector on the slab or other means.
  p
    | It is estimated in the UK that internal temperatures can
    | typically be held at 6-8&deg;C below peak external summer time
    | temperatures and in hotter climates particularly where there is a
    | sharp contrast between Summer day temperatures and Summer night
    | temperatures the reduction would be considerably more.
  p
    | Consideration should be given to the slab at the design stage
    | and in order to increase the exposed area of the slab a coffered
    | or sinusoidal shape is advantageous. It has been demonstrated the
    | effective rate of heat flow between the internal surface of a
    | construction and the space temperature is the limiting factor to
    | achieving heat storage rather than the thickness of the slab.
    | (The maximum slab thickness required appears to be up to
    | approximately 100mm.) In order to maximise the heat flow
    | relationship it is concluded that mechanical ventilation should
    | be used, the heatflow is further enhanced by ducting air through
    | hollow cores in precast concrete slabs and the best heat flow was
    | achieved by ducting supply air close to the slab surface beneath
    | steel sheeting.
  h4#termodeck
    | TermoDeck Passive Temperature Control
    | Systems
  p
    | The Swedish developed TermoDeck system uses the slab as both a
    | structural component and also a means of ducting ventilation
    | through the building through oval or round shaped holes within
    | the concrete structure. Over 200 projects have been installed in
    | Sweden and Norway and latterly Holland and Belgium.
  p
    | With the TermoDeck systems the slab temperature is very close
    | to the room temperature and makes it suitable for displacement
    | ventilation as well as mixed flow ventilation (see later for
    | comparison of displacement and mixed flow). In Summer the supply
    | air fans at night bring in the cool air into the hollow slabs to
    | cool the building and the warm outside air is cooled in the
    | daytime.
  p
    | Two systems have recently been installed in the UK and the
    | latest building The Elizabeth Fry Building uses mechanical
    | ventilation with heating and no mechanical cooling at all. Mixed
    | flow ventilation is used throughout the building except the
    | Lecture Theatre where displacement ventilation is used. The
    | building has created much interest and is being closely monitored
    | for energy consumption and occupant satisfaction by the PROBE
    | team (independent organisation monitoring buildings after
    | occupation). The slab temperature is kept at 22&deg;C with a
    | deadband of 1/2&deg;C for heating and 1.5&deg;C for cooling.
    | TermoDeck&rsquo;s inventor Loa Anderson predicts with computer
    | modelling that at an external peak of 29&deg;C the peak internal
    | temperature should not rise above 26&deg;C with a daily average room
    | temperature around 22C.
  p
    | The PROBE team conclude that of 12 recently constructed
    | buildings in the UK this building had the highest occupant
    | comfort scores and are also recorded the highest comfort scores
    | recorded by the independent survey specialists Building Use
    | Studies. Typical energy consumption for heating and ventilation
    | for the UK are around 200 kWh/msq./y and for Sweden using
    | TermoDeck between 30-50 kWh/msq./y, this building seems to be
    | following the Swedish trend.
  p
    | The TermoDeck system has since been installed in hot climates
    | such as Saudi Arabia where the slab tends to be kept at a
    | temperature of 19C. The manufacturers claim that the cooling
    | plant capacity and associated equipment is substantially reduced
    | and the Elizabeth Fry research appears to confirm significantly
    | reduced cooling loads and running costs.
  p
    | The system may be used with mixed flow or displacement
    | ventilation, night cooling, free cooling, desiccant cooling,
    | packaged equipment cooling, DX equipment, chilled water equipment
    | and so is versatile.
  p
    | As the room temperature and slab temperature are similar the
    | room temperature tends to be uniform and therefore assists
    | comfort.
  h4#barra The Barra System
  p
    | This system was developed by Horazio Barra in Italy and
    | originally used as a passive solar heating system. Floors of
    | reinforced concrete are used with embedded channels utilising
    | hollow concrete blocks. Outdoor air is blown through the channels
    | and when originally used the hot air emerging from the insulated
    | southern facing collecting wall served as thermal storage. The
    | system may be modified and used as a cooling system as well. At
    | night a fan blows ambient air through the channels and thus cold
    | night energy will be stored within the ceiling mass.
  p
    | During the daytime the cooled ceiling will absorb the heat
    | from the interior space passively.
  h4#roofs Roofs, Roof Ponds and the Soil
  p
    | In his book 
    cite
      | &apos;Passive and Low Energy Cooling of
      | Buildings&rsquo;
    |  Professor Baruch Givoni describes methods of
    | cooling using the above.
  p
    | As roofs are usually insulated to minimise both heat loss and
    | external heat gain it is not possible to take advantage of low
    | nocturnal temperature unless the roof is designed in a certain
    | way. A simple method of achieving radiant cooling is to use a
    | heavy but highly conductive roof exposed to the sky at night
    | which would be highly insulated in the day using operable
    | insulation although it is the opinion of Professor Givoni that
    | practical and movable insulation is not available at present.
    | Several buildings in the United States have used the &lsquo;Skytherm&apos;
    | system in which the roof is made of structural steel deck plates.
    | Plastic bags filled with water are placed above the steel decks
    | and above them are movable insulation panels that are moved by a
    | motor. In Winter the water bags are exposed to the sun in the day
    | and covered by the insulation panels at night. In Summer when
    | cooling is required the water bags are exposed and cooled at
    | night and insulated during the daytime. As the cooled water bags
    | are in direct contact with the metal deck the ceiling serves as a
    | cooling element over the entire space. However it is the opinion
    | of Professor Givoni that the availability of a simple and trouble
    | free system of movable insulation is still in question.
  p
    | In contrast to using indirect and direct evaporative cooling
    | in conjunction with air being introduced into a building and as
    | previously described it is possible to cool a roof by placing a
    | cooled pond over it. The building is then cooled by conduction
    | across the roof which lowers indoor air and radiant temperatures
    | without increasing the indoor water vapour content.
  p
    | Professor Givoni suggests the ceiling temperature in the case
    | of a concrete roof over a well insulated building would be about
    | 2&deg;C above the water temperature. It is concluded that the water
    | temperature of a shaded pond follows approximately the average
    | wet bulb temperature. The suggested maximum wet bulb temperature
    | for applications of this type of evaporative cooling in summer is
    | 22-24&deg;C and the dry bulb temperature not higher than 42-44C.
  p
    | A shaded pond or lake adjacent to a building will provide cool
    | water to fan coil units or similar within a building and will
    | provide useful cooling in hot climates. For a more detailed
    | appraisal of this subject and calculations see Nick Pines website
    | detailed at the end of this article. An indirect heat exchanger
    | submerged in the water could be used and in this way cold water
    | circulated to a closed loop system perhaps connected to mass
    | produced fan coil units or other terminals. A submersible pump in
    | the pond would be used to circulate water within the &lsquo;open&rsquo; loop
    | using a stainless steel fine mesh filter say of 20 micron to keep
    | the heat exchanger clean, a submersed non-corrosive carbon fibre
    | heat exchanger would best be used for separating the open and
    | closed circuits. If the water were taken directly from the pond
    | to the fan coil, problems of corrosion and salt build up would
    | probably make this at best a temporary measure even if the water
    | was well filtered.
  p
    | Professor Givoni in his book suggests a number of methods of
    | using the soil as a cooling source stating that in temperate
    | climates at a depth of 2 to 3 metres the natural temperature of
    | the soil could be enough to serve as a cooling source but in hot
    | climates the soil temperature is usually too high. However there
    | are simple methods to lower the soil temperature such as covering
    | the soil with mulch at least 10cm thick and in regions with dry
    | climates irrigating it, or raising the building off the ground
    | and allowing water that was provided by either summer rains or
    | irrigation to evaporate from the shaded soil surface.
  p
    | Once cooled the reduced soil temperature may be used in a
    | variety of ways for both passive and active cooling.

    |  the following research was described:

    p
      | &ldquo;A black shingled roof was used as a collector/regenerator
      | for the evaporation of water to obtain a strong solution of
      | lithium chloride absorbent. In the house, water (the
      | refrigerant) is sprayed into an evaporator and this was
      | evacuated to a pressure of about 5mm of mercury where the
      | water immediately flashes into vapour. Cold water pumped from
      | the bottom of the evaporator then flowed through a fan coil
      | unit which blew cold air into the area requiring cooling.
      | (Fan coil units are usually used with chilled water in the
      | HVAC industry). Water vapour from the evaporator flows over
      | the absorber where it is absorbed by the concentrated
      | absorbent (lithium chloride). The continuous absorption of
      | water vapour maintained a low pressure in the system and
      | permitted flashing of water in the evaporator. The product of

      | collected at the bottom of the absorber to be pumped over the

    | roof say of 10m x 10m (100square metres or approx. 1000square
    | feet) could provide 35kW (10 tons) of cooling for very little
    | energy costs.
  p
    | If the system was used to provide cold water to a heat
    | exchanger which then had cold air blown through to say a passive
    | Termodeck ventilation system in the building then during hot
    | weather in many buildings it is possible that further cooling may
    | not be required at all and, of course, the running costs would be
    | minimal.
  p
    | This research should not be lost on building owners and
    | building service designers particularly in hot climates and it is
    | quite possible that the research could further point the way to
    | low energy design in the future.

    | Practical Choices for Free Cooling and Low

  p
    | Clearly the application of free cooling and low energy cooling
    | to a building is an extremely complex choice.
  h4#dispvmixed Displacement vs Mixed Flow
  p
    | If the building is high enough for a displacement effect to
    | take place and has a high sensible gain, then this will minimise
    | the cooling capacity required, especially if the heat gain is at
    | high level where much of the heat may be exhausted at source.
    | With a room of 2.3 metres height and below, a displacement effect
    | will not take place so it would be counter-productive to use
    | displacement terminals; in fact, a higher room volume of air
    | would be required as the cooling supply air room temperatures
    | would have to be higher than for high level mixed flow
    | distribution.

  h4#minoutsideair
    | Consideration of Minimum Outside Air
    | Quantities and Odour Control
  p
    | The outside air sensible and latent cooling load may well be
    | one of the largest single loads imposed on cooling plant for an
    | air conditioned building and so is here considered in some
    | detail.
  p
    | There is no question that both the quantity and quality of
    | outside air are crucial to the comfort of occupants in air
    | conditioned buildings and the efficacy of the air conditioning of
    | an entire building when related to comfort may be negated by the
    | introduction of too little or poor quality outside air. Of course
    | when designing low energy buildings there is a pressure to
    | minimise outdoor air in order to keep plant size small and
    | running costs low. This subject has therefore been the recipient
    | of a huge amount of research throughout the world since the
    | inception of modern air conditioning and is as important now as
    | it has ever been particularly as modern buildings are becoming
    | more &lsquo;tight&rsquo; and outdoor air quality, in particular in urban
    | areas, poorer in quality.
  p
    | The trend in Scandinavia and more recently in Canada are for
    | low energy buildings&nbsp;- and yet using 100% outside and
    | exhaust air with heat recovery from the exhausted air, this may
    | well point the way for the future particularly in temperate
    | climates. Even in urban areas with poor quality outdoor air the
    | use of good carbon filters, electrostatic filters and/or HEPA
    | filters will improve the quality of the air immeasurably.
  p
    | Clearly if 100% of the air circulated through a building is
    | from outside this would impose the maximum cooling load on
    | cooling plant when the external ambient is hot and humid. Before
    | useful cooling of the building is to be achieved the cooling
    | plant has to reduce both the external dry bulb and moisture
    | content to room conditions before the cooling plant provides
    | useful indoor cooling and this will reflect both on the cooling
    | plant size and the running costs. Alternatively the other extreme
    | is if the system recirculates 100% of the air and in a &lsquo;tight&apos;
    | building the outside air would exert little influence on the
    | building cooling loads during peak conditions and this would
    | reflect in smaller cooling plant being required and lower running
    | costs.
  p
    | In reality a minority only of air conditioned buildings use
    | either of these extremes.
  p
    | It is instructive to look back briefly at a some of the
    | history of outside air research in order to appreciate the
    | present day situation.
  p
    | Outdoor air is needed to meet the oxygen needs of occupants,
    | the dilution of odours, contaminants and gases in particular
    | carbon dioxide. The early work of Yaglou et al in 1936 provided
    | the benchmark throughout most of the world for many years and
    | this was based on work in American schools and determined the
    | quantity of outside air needed to provide a satisfactory
    | reduction of odours depending both on the number of people
    | present and personal hygiene. This research determined that for
    | the same volume of air that odours dispersed more rapidly when
    | each occupied a greater volume of the room air. The guidelines
    | for many years were therefore directly related to the quantity of
    | outside air per occupant and consideration was also given to the
    | likely concentration of the occupants.
  p
    | The minimum outdoor air quantities in the 1980s of 5 litres/s
    | and 2.5 litres/s per person adopted by the UK and North America
    | respectively were shown to be inadequate by laboratory based work
    | of Leaderer, B P and Cain &lsquo;Air quality in buildings during
    | smoking and non-smoking occupancy&apos;. The work demonstrated that
    | the ventilation rates were inadequate when considering odour
    | levels perceived by people when first entering an already
    | occupied space and that the density of occupancy had no bearing
    | on fresh air requirements. Minimum air quantities were then
    | increased in both countries to 8 litres/second in the UK and to
    | 7.5 litres/sec per person in North America.
  p
    | These figures were recommended particularly because of concern
    | over the incidence of ventilation related problems in air
    | condition buildings and based on the work of the aforementioned
    | Leaderer et al. and also the work of P.O Fanger &lsquo;Body odour and
    | carbon dioxide, minimum ventilation rates&rsquo;.
  p
    | The work of P.O. Fanger, J. Lauridsen, P. Bluyssen and G
    | Clausen 
    cite
      | &apos;Air pollution sources in offices and assembly
      | halls, quantified by the Olf unit&apos;
    |  addressed the question
    | of ventilation rates and the relationship with a unit of odour
    | intensity called the &lsquo;Olf&apos;. In this important work a large number
    | of people were subjected to odour levels in a variety of
    | naturally and mechanically ventilated buildings and air
    | conditioned spaces. The research found that for every occupant
    | and associated odour there may be another four to five odour
    | equivalents (olfs) released from building materials, furnishings
    | and the air handling system.
  p
    | Auditoria are particularly thought to be prone to soiling of
    | internal surfaces because of the extent of soft furnishings and
    | acoustically absorbent finishes.
  h3#odour The Units of Odour Intensity
  p
    | The contribution to the industry of the work of Professor
    | Fanger and his team in Denmark has been immense. Not only did
    | Professor Fanger develop his well known &lsquo;comfort equation&apos;, which
    | was developed empirically and contains the many variables known
    | to make up the comfort of people, but as well as other work also
    | developed the concept of the units of odour&nbsp;- the olf and
    | the decipol. The nature of indoor pollution is very difficult to
    | assess because of the many indoor chemicals involved. Even for
    | pollutants that may be detected because of their odour or
    | irritation effect there is the issue of who should be the judge
    | of what is acceptable. Within buildings pollutants come from many
    | sources such as the building and furnishing materials and
    | chemicals such as correction fluid or from equipment such as
    | photocopiers.
  p
    | Hundreds of volatile organic compounds have been identified in
    | indoor air and most seem to be much lower than for occupational
    | standards for industrial workers although little appears to be
    | known of the effects of long term exposure. The sheer complexity
    | of measuring indoor pollution raises the question of people
    | themselves being used as the test instrument. The use of
    | questionnaires given to building occupants for identifying and
    | assessing problems with indoor environment has been established
    | for some time. The approach of using a panel of assessors to
    | judge air quality has been advocated by Professor Fanger and has
    | given rise to the empirical units of the olf and the decipol. One
    | olf is defined as the air pollution produced by one &lsquo;standard&apos;
    | person (a standard person is also defined) and a decipol is
    | defined as the perceived air pollution level in a space in which
    | there is a source strength of one olf and which is ventilated at
    | 10 litres/second with unpolluted air. The proposed European air
    | quality standard 
    cite
      | &apos;prENV 1752 Ventilation for buildings:
      | design criteria for the indoor environment&apos;
    |  often referred
    | to as the &lsquo;Fanger Standard&rsquo; and at least 7 years in the making
    | has failed to be adopted by Europe as it was not endorsed by 71%
    | of the 17 participating countries. The proposed standard is
    | however a useful guide and has much valuable information although
    | the assessment of outside air quantities based on the use of the
    | olf and decipol is the subject of the greatest controversy.

  h3#ashrae ASHRAE Standard 62
  p
    | ASHRAE Standard 62 
    cite
      | &apos;Ventilation for acceptable indoor
      | air quality&apos;
    |  was first published in 1989 and introduced
    | the calculation of a dilution rate based on limiting
    | concentrations for non-industrial exposure to
    | contaminants. The Standard uses ambient air quality standards
    | produced by the US Environmental Protection Agency as a basis for
    | their definition of fresh air. This specifies exposure limits for
    | common pollutants and if examination of records shows that these
    | are exceeded then it is recommended that suitable air cleaning
    | apparatus be installed. It also introduced a technique for
    | determining the lead and lag time depending on the room volume
    | per person and their fresh air allowance.
  p
    | Since there is potential for a wide diversity in pollutant
    | sources, contaminant types and population susceptibility to
    | pollutants, it is stressed that compliance with Standard 62 does
    | not ensure acceptable indoor air quality for everyone.
  p
    | The Standard is under constant review but major revisions to
    | the Standard in 1996 which were to include the adoption of the
    | olf and decipol unit of measurement were abandoned. It is
    | understood that the Standard will be progressively updated as
    | firm data on odour emerges.
  h3#trends
    | Future Trends for Outside Air Quantities and
    | Cooling Load Implications
  p
    | There appears to be a trend in Europe that the lead of the
    | Scandinavians is being followed of a tendency to use 100% outside
    | and exhaust air systems. Of course in a temperate climate this
    | would mean that &lsquo;free cooling&rsquo; would be provided for much of the
    | year using very simple control. As heat exchanger efficiencies
    | are being increased and simple and inexpensive methods of cooling
    | are used then the &lsquo;knee jerk&rsquo; reaction to minimise outside air
    | may cease to be so important. The indoor air quality within a
    | building using 100% outside air and exhaust air and a well
    | filtered system would unquestionably provide optimum indoor air
    | quality especially if used in conjunction with displacement
    | ventilation removing contaminants etc. from the occupied zone.
  p
    | In hot climates too, the prospect of introducing 100% outside
    | and exhausting 100% air at peak conditions may also be less
    | daunting using efficient heat exchangers. When supplying 100%
    | outside air at typical climate design conditions of say 47&deg;C dry
    | bulb and 24&deg;C wet bulb with return air of say 25&deg;C dry bulb at
    | 55% RH with the use of a thermal wheel and an indirect evaporator
    | the incoming dry bulb temperature could be reduced to as little
    | as a 1.0&deg;C increase above the return air temperature. (i.e.
    | supply air dry bulb would be 26.0C&nbsp;- the figures assume 94%
    | efficiency for the humidifier and 75% efficiency for the thermal
    | wheel.) This figure seems perhaps surprisingly, low, particularly
    | as in hot climates the outdoor air load is often calculated to be
    | the largest single cooling requirement, especially if there is a
    | large outside air requirement due to high occupancies. But as may
    | be seen the sensible outside air load is almost reduced to zero.
  p
    | If the air then passes through a cooling coil supplied with
    | low grade cooling water at 15&deg;C and having a sensible to total
    | ratio of 0.38 then the off coil would be 19&deg;C dry bulb and
    | 18.89&deg;C wet bulb. These temperatures are ideal for displacement
    | ventilation and it is possible that no further cooling would be
    | required.
  p
    | In a more humid climate say at 45&deg;C dry bulb and 31&deg;C wet
    | bulb a similar process could be followed but desiccants used to
    | reduce the wet bulb temperature of the incoming air.
  h4#existing
    | Existing Buildings&nbsp;- the
    | Retrospective Addition of Cooling
  p
    | Generally the simplest, least disruptive and most used method
    | of providing cooling to an existing building is to use mass
    | produced mixed flow direct expansion equipment but with much of
    | this equipment there is little opportunity to provide free or low
    | energy cooling.
  p
    | An option to consider would be to provide air handling
    | equipment with modulating dampers for free cooling using enthalpy
    | or temperature control as described previously. Even the most
    | temperate climates are likely to require further cooling at high
    | external ambient temperatures in Summer and the addition of
    | indirect and direct evaporative humidifiers should therefore be
    | considered. If further cooling is required then desiccant systems
    | with heat recovery and solar regeneration should be considered
    | perhaps using phase change equipment in hot countries. Research
    | seems to indicate that in Europe in order to minimise
    | regeneration costs then the use of ceiling coils providing
    | sensible cooling and using low grade pond water or if that is not
    | practical, cooling water directly from towers.
  h4#new New Buildings
  p
    | There are many more choices and options when designing
    | building services as part of the design team for a new buildings.
    | The thrust of this article is, in particular, directed at
    | buildings with high internal sensible loads.
  p
    | Clearly everything should be done to mitigate the effect of
    | the high sensible load such as designing the height of rooms so
    | that displacement ventilation may be used and if possible remove
    | internal sensible gain at source or high level and it therefore
    | does not become part of the cooling load. This would be
    | particularly effective in buildings such as television studios
    | and displacement ventilation has the advantage of being able to
    | achieve very low noise levels as the outlet velocity from the
    | terminals is so low. A suitably silenced displacement system
    | could achieve down to Noise Criteria (NC) 10 and this has been
    | achieved at the well known Air Studio in the UK, it is not
    | practical to achieve such a low noise level with mixed flow
    | ventilation as higher velocities are required for the throw of
    | the air. In reality NC 10 is an extraordinary low sound criteria
    | for an air conditioning system and most studios even with live
    | microphone applications are only designed to NC20 which is still
    | a very low sound criteria. (&apos;Talking book&rsquo; studios are an
    | exception because of the pause between words and a lower sound
    | criteria is therefore often required). For further information on
    | air conditioning for studios and sound control see 
    cite &apos;

      cite
        | Practical Ventilation and Air
        | Conditioning Design for Studios, Control Rooms and Auditoria
    cite &apos;
    | .
  p
    | The use of passive cooling could be considered at an early
    | stage such as the use of TermoDeck or the use of heat sinks such
    | as roof ponds and the soil.
  p
    | Air handling equipment would be likely to be provided with
    | modulating dampers for free cooling using enthalpy or temperature
    | control, indirect and direct humidifiers and desiccant systems
    | with solar regeneration in hot countries and all as described
    | under the previous headings. With high occupancy buildings such
    | as Auditoriums or Concert Halls it is probable that a 100%
    | outside air will be required in which case it is essential to use
    | heat recovery equipment. There appears to be little doubt that
    | low level displacement ventilation is the way forward with high
    | occupancy buildings such as these and the trend appears to be the
    | positioning of terminals at each seat for occupant adjustment and
    | control&nbsp;- this design was used in the recently refurbished
    | Glyndebourne Opera House in the UK.
  p
    | As stated previously the design should be used to augment the
    | bioclimate architectural design of the building.
  p
    | As fundamental decisions have to be taken for the efficacious
    | application of low energy design for new or refurbished buildings
    | it is clearly essential that the building service designer should
    | be consulted from the outset.
  h2#conclusion Conclusion
  p
    | An intriguing question is, just why is it that refrigeration
    | equipment quite often as big as a house and often constantly
    | energised is used to cool a medium sized office block in a
    | temperate climate let alone a hot climate. Willis Carrier the
    | father of modern air conditioning industry and whose name the
    | largest manufacturer in the world still bares, used the simple
    | expedient of passing air over ice to effectively cool a print
    | works. The answer possibly is that is simply the way the industry
    | evolved with the simplicity of the application of modern and at
    | the time universally acclaimed &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; refrigerants in much the
    | same way as petrol driven engines evolved rather than steam
    | driven engines or the aeroplane rather than the airship.
  p
    | Energy in the past and still today in some countries was just
    | not an issue. But now in the HVAC industry, it has not been
    | financial resources that has concentrated the mind but the
    | criticism of the use of energy and damage to the earths
    | environment. Whatever your point of view this has regardless set
    | a challenge to the modern HVAC engineer and the status quo is
    | unlikely to be maintained simply by finding of the &lsquo;holy grail&apos;
    | of a totally benign &lsquo;drop in&rsquo; replacement for the ubiquitous HCFC
    | known as R22. In many peoples view the industry is changing
    | forever and if it is that a hospital in a poor hot country
    | through simple cost effective and simply maintainable engineering
    | is the benefactor then that has to be wonderful. It is no
    | different to what engineers have had to address through the ages
    | that a change of circumstances has been a pressure to re-think
    | and innovate and that surely is the exciting challenge to our
    | industry.
