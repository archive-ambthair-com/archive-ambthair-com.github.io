humidity of an atmospheric environment. Air conditioning is always associated with the cooling and dehumidification process of air and is always therefore identified with refrigeration
equipment.</p><p>The full control over relative humidity by the addition of moisture by means of a humidifier
and the use of a humidistat constitutes full air conditioning, but this control is not always
exercised. However, the more often used partial or comfort air conditioning which uses
refrigeration equipment only and is therefore capable of cooling as well as dehumidifying
is still referred to as air conditioning.</p><p>From the foregoing therefore the term<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ventilation’ should not be confused with air
conditioning as refrigeration equipment is not necessarily provided with ventilation
equipment.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q2" itemprop="name">What is relative humidity?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>The atmosphere always contains moisture in the form of water vapour.  The maximum amount
of water vapour that may be contained in the air depends on the temperature of the air
and the higher the temperature of the air, the more water vapour may be contained.
At high temperatures and high moisture contents extreme discomfort is experienced as the
evaporation of moisture from the body into the atmosphere by the process of perspiration
becomes difficult.</p><p>In the air conditioning process the moisture content of the air may be reduced by the
use of a cooling coil or added by the use of a humidifier.</p><p>The term <dfn>relative humidity</dfn> is simply a ratio between the actual moisture content of
           the air compared with the moisture content of the air required for saturation at the same
           temperature, ie at 100% relative humidity (also known as saturation point).</p><p>The air conditioning engineer uses the psychrometric chart to analyse how the state of
moist air alters as an air conditioning process takes place.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q3" itemprop="name">Is there a difference between comfort conditioning and industrial conditioning?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yes, the object of comfort conditioning as the name implies is solely to provide a comfortable
environment for the majority of occupants. Humans are reasonably tolerant to humidity and
may be comfortable from a range of between 55% and 20% relative humidity at normal comfort
temperatures.  It is therefore common when specifying to limit the humidity in summer and
not specify a limit in winter.  Typically therefore a specification would state an internal
condition of 22°C&nbsp;/ 50% relative humidity being maintained at 30°C&nbsp;/ 20°C wet bulb
external conditions in summer.  In winter the specification may typically be 21°C
internal temperature at -3°C saturated outside air temperature.</p><p>Industrial conditioning is provided generally for a process which requires a closely
controlled atmosphere.  A typical specification may be that an internal environment
is required of say 21°C&nbsp;±0.5°C and 50% relative humidity ±2.5% at all
external conditions.  It will be seen therefore that the industrial conditions for
clearly defined limits rather than comfort conditioning which is based on statistical
surveys of occupants feelings.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q4" itemprop="name">What is meant by a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>ton’ of refrigeration?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Confusingly the unit has little to do with weight, as used in common parlance.  One ton of refrigeration is the term
used to refer to 12,000&nbsp;B.T.U.s/hour (British Thermal Units/Hour) of cooling effect.
Thus a chiller or condensing unit with a cooling capacity of 60,000&nbsp;B.T.U.s/hour is said
to have a capacity of 5&nbsp;tons. It should be noted that the unit B.T.U./hour is a unit of heat
flow still widely used in North America, Canada and parts of Asia whereas Europe uses the
‘watt’.  One ton of refrigeration approximates to 3.5kW of cooling.</p><p>The origin of the term is the amount of heat absorbed by one ton of ice when melting from solid to liquid state at 32°F and assuming a latent heat of ice of 144&nbsp;B.T.U.s/lb.  The heat absorbed is found to be 288,000&nbsp;B.T.U.s over 24&nbsp;hours, or 12,000&nbsp;B.T.U.s/hour (in reality the latent heat of ice is slightly less than 144&nbsp;B.T.U.s/lb.)</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q5" itemprop="name">What is direct expansion equipment?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p><span class="pull-single">‘</span>Direct expansion,’<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span><span class="small-caps">DX</span>,’<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>refrigeration’ or<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>split’ units are all generic terms used to identify
the same equipment.  The terms are in fact rather loose but in any event it has become
accepted that the terms   refer to two or more units, one usually positioned externally and one
or more usually positioned internally.  The  units are connected together by site installed
refrigeration pipework which is charged with a refrigerant.
The external unit may take one of three forms:</p><ol id="externalunitlist"><li>The heat pump&nbsp;- which consists of a fan, compressor, coil and reversing valve, and rejects
unwanted heat to atmosphere during the cooling cycle and extracts heat from the
atmosphere during the heating cycle.</li><li>The condensing unit&nbsp;- which is as described above but does not have a reversing valve
and therefore cools only.</li><li>The condenser which consists of a fan and coil (as the compressor is contained in the
indoor unit); the condenser is used less often than (a) and (b).</li></ol><p>The indoor units consist of fan coil units or air handling units which may be located in the
atmosphere being air conditioned or remotely in a plant room.</p><p>Some manufacturers produce<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>external’ units that may be located internally and in the
case of these units ductwork is usually connected to atmosphere to reject heat or extract heat.</p><p><span class="small-caps">DX</span> systems are in direct contrast to hydraulic systems or chilled water systems.
With these systems cooling is achieved by circulating chilled water with a hydraulic
pump</p><p>Generally speaking with direct expansion equipment the manufacturers match the indoor and
the outdoor units and many well not sell the units individually for fear of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>mismatching’
occurring.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q6" itemprop="name">What is mixed flow ventilation&nbsp;/ air conditioning?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Mixed flow describes a method of air distribution from an air conditioning or ventilation
system.</p><p>It has been and still is the most widely used method of supplying air into an atmosphere
being air conditioned. This form of air distribution commonly uses ceiling diffusers or wall
grilles at high level. As  most air conditioning units are manufactured for the mixed flow air distribution
market the associated air handling equipment has also been developed for the mixed flow
market.This air handling equipment is therefore widely available and at very competitive
costs as there are many manufacturers of this equipment throughout the world.</p><p>Recently displacement air distribution has gained in popularity, mainly due to comfort
and cleanliness considerations. (With displacement ventilation air is introduced
into the air conditioned space at low level and at low velocity). As the displacement
market is still much smaller than the the size of the mixed flow market the complimentary
air handling equipment has lagged behind and has generally to be made to order and is thus
more expensive.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q7" itemprop="name">In view of this is it not possible to use direct expansion equipment in a low level
displacement application?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>When using displacement ventilation it is necessary to design the system so that the
during the cooling cycle the air temperature being supplied to the space is at a higher
temperature than is used for mixed flow ventilation&nbsp;- this is because of comfort considerations.  However, if it is accepted that the air temperature adjacent to low level
outlets is uncomfortably low and the layout of the space can be made to accommodate
this then it may be a cost effective solution&nbsp;- particularly for high spaces such as large studios
where it is inevitable a vertical temperature gradient arises but is of little consequence
how high the air temperature is above the occupied zone. This system breaks all the rules
of accepted displacement design but may be an acceptable compromise.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q8" itemprop="name">If it were possible to vary the off coil temperature during the cooling cycle of direct
expansion equipment wouldn’t this have the same advantage as using a chilled water system?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>It is possible to vary the off coil temperature using the direct expansion equipment by the use
of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>hot gas bypass’ and this would make it acceptable for displacement.  There are a few manufacturers that modify their equipment for<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">‘</span>hot gas bypass’ using larger compressors, and this equipment may be applied to displacement ventilation.</p></div></div></li><li itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q9" itemprop="name">When would a system be designed with chilled water as the cooling medium rather than direct expansion equipment?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>There are several considerations:</p><ul><li>If the air conditioning system, no matter how small, was to be designed as a conventional
displacement system then chilled water, with its inherent infinitely variable off coil
temperatures, would generally be required.</li><li>Direct expansion systems have considerably less capital costs on small to medium sized installations. However, the capital costs of both types of systems become comparative after about a cooling load of about 1000kW. (This figure varies greatly depending on the site layout.)</li><li>Chilled water should be used for systems where flexibility is required i.e. where partitions and room layouts are to be altered regularly.</li></ul></div></div></li><li class="pt-3" itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question"><p class="question" id="q10" itemprop="name">What about heating?</p><div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Chilled water systems require a separate source of heating. This would normally be in the form of a boiler and a hot water flow and return similar to the chilled water system.
It is possible to provide chilled water and hot water through the same set of pipes, (known as a manual or automatic changeover system) but these systems are more appropriate in offices when there is a clearly defined heating and cooling changeover season.</p><p>An alternative is to use electrical resistance heating although the running costs are usually prohibitively high.</p><p>Direct expansion equipment may utilise a heat pump which heats and cools through the same set of pipes.</p></div></div></li></ol><aside class="card"><h5 class="card-header">This article is provided by Ambthair&nbsp;Services</h5><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">We provide air conditioning design and consultancy, specialising in studios and low energy systems.</p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="contact.html">Contact us</a></div></aside></main></article></div><footer class="py-4 bg-primary mt-auto"><div class="container"><p class="text-center text-white">Copyright © 2024 Ambthair Services Ltd.</p></div></footer><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-OgVRvuATP1z7JjHLkuOU7Xw704+h835Lr+6QL9UvYjZE3Ipu6Tp75j7Bh/kR0JKI" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon="{&quot;token&quot;: &quot;43135c8b3dfb4e65bd227193a8be7f50&quot;}"></script></body></html>
