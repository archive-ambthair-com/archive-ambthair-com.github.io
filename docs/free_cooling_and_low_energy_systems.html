interest in how the environment in their building is achieved as
the choices at arriving at what may or may not be a satisfactory
environment to the <span class="small-caps">HVAC</span> engineer are legion and all too often and
regrettably have to be taken in isolation. The choices will
probably have to be lived with throughout the life of the
building and as well as being one of the highest annual outgoing
costs, further, the comfort of the building will probably be the
single most important issue to the occupier effecting both their
well being and health. The owners interest would empower the HVAC
designer who would explain the choices at the outset and would
explain the trade off costs of compromise that are often required
in the building design process and construction.</p><p>Human comfort and low energy systems in buildings are not
necessarily a contradiction in terms, in fact it is a paradox
that low energy systems more often than not provide better
comfort. It is also a paradox that in buildings in cities
throughout the world, even in temperate climates, that vapour
compression equipment is providing cooling throughout the year
even though the external temperature for the vast majority of
time is lower than the internal building ambient temperature. Any
feedback about any of the information discussed in this article,
such as that by Mr Dahliwal and contained herein, would be most
appreciated by the writer as of course would be any other
feedback.</p><p>As the article is intended for and warmly welcomes those who
may have no knowledge at all of the <span class="small-caps">HVAC</span> industry, the writer
apologises in advance for what may be regarded by others as
obvious or oversimplification.</p><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3><p>This article discusses practical methods of minimising the
effect in buildings of, in particular, internal heat gains which
have become more prevalent in recent years because of the
information technology industry etc. and also discusses the issue
of optimum comfort. The thrust of the article is less concerned
with rural buildings in temperate climates which even with quite
high internal heat gains may only overheat for a few weeks a year
but more concerned with urban buildings in temperate or hot
climates. In his excellent book <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Passive and Low Energy
Cooling of Buildings&rsquo;</cite> the author Professor Baruch Givoni
differentiates between with what he describes as<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>tropical
bioclimate architecture&rsquo; and other methods of achieving cooling
in buildings.</p><p>Tropical bioclimate architecture is more to do with mitigating
the effect of heat by the use of shading, colour, orientation of
building, size of windows and structure of building and its
effective application is essential in any hot climate and, of
course, many societies have practised and have become extremely
skilful in using this method of protecting themselves from hot
climates over many years. However this article is more related to
methods of introducing cooling to buildings by passive or active
ventilation or other means and of course it is assumed that these
methods should be used to augment effective tropical bioclimate
architectural techniques.</p><p>An American called Jacob Perkins living in London in the U.K.
patented the first closed vapour compression refrigeration system
in 1884. The refrigerants used were generally flammable and/or
toxic and generally not very satisfactory. The dramatic and
acclaimed introduction of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 1930 in
the form of <span class="small-caps">R12</span> at a meeting of the American Chemical Society
marked the beginning of modern refrigerants which would, in time,
revolutionise technology throughout the world.</p><p>In 1974 Messrs. Rowland and Monila presented the hypothesis
that chlorofluorocarbons and other gases were damaging the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere by the Greenhouse Effect which they claimed
increased the atmospheres ability to absorb infra-red radiation
therefore reducing the rate at which the planet is able to shed
energy into space and also by Ozone Depletion which stated that
gases accumulating in the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere acted as a catalyst
to destroy ozone.</p><h3 id="international">International Agreement and
Commitment and the Kyoto Protocol</h3><p>The international agreement reached at the Rio Earth Summit in
1992 resulted in The Framework Convention on Climate Change and
placed commitments on developed countries to devise policies and
measures to bring down greenhouse gas emission to their 1990
levels by the year 2000 and also to provide financial assistance
to developing countries to meet their general commitments.</p><p>Some countries will meet those targets but others will not.
Hence, international agreement was reached that the next step had
to involve a framework leading eventually to legally binding
targets. The world&rsquo;s industrialised nations signed the Kyoto
Protocol on the 11th December 1997 agreeing to a collective cut
in greenhouse gas emissions of 5.2% by 2008-2012. The emissions
targets have as yet no legal<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>teeth&rsquo; although it is intended to
try and introduce legal enforceability at some stage, to date 176
countries have signed the agreement. The target will be achieved
by cuts of 8% by Switzerland, most Central and East European
states and the European Union, 7% by the <span class="small-caps">US</span> and 6% by Canada,
Hungary and Japan, the countries of Poland, Russia, New Zealand
and Ukraine are to stabilise their emissions, while Norway may
increase emissions by up to 1%, Australia by up to 8%, and
Iceland 10%.</p><p>The European Union have agreed amongst themselves that
reductions will be:</p><div class="text-center"><table class="table table-striped table-bordered mb-4" style="width: auto; margin: auto; text-align: left"><tbody><tr><td>Austria</td><td>-10%</td></tr><tr><td>Belgium</td><td>-7.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Denmark</td><td>-21%</td></tr><tr><td>Finland</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>-21%</td></tr><tr><td>Greece</td><td>+25%</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>+13%</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>-6.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Luxembourg</td><td>-28%</td></tr><tr><td>Netherlands</td><td>-6%</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>+27%</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>+15%</td></tr><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>+4%</td></tr><tr><td><span class="small-caps">UK</span></td><td>-12.5%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It was agreed the reduction in the three main greenhouse gases
of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane would be measured
against a baseline of 1990 emissions, whereas sulphur
hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons would be
set against a baseline of 1995 levels. The greenhouse gas target
is now expressed as the total national emissions over the period
of 2008 to 2012 to facilitate calculations of averages.</p><p>Nations may meet these binding targets by joint
implementation, for instance a developed country may take credit
for funding greenhouse cuts in another country. The Protocol also
envisages developed countries trading greenhouse gas emissions
between themselves to the effect that a country that has
achieved, or even exceeded its own respective target could,
hypothetically, exchange with another country which is struggling
to achieve its respective target.</p><p>The current position of HCFCs (of which <span class="small-caps">R22</span> is the most
prevalent in air conditioning) in Europe is:</p><ul><li>35% cut by 2002</li><li>60% by 2007</li><li>80% by 2010</li><li>95% by 2013</li><li>Phase out by 2015</li></ul><p>The new draft is more radical and proposes the following:</p><ul><li>10% cut by 2002</li><li>65% by 2003</li><li>70% by 2004</li><li>95% by 2008</li><li>Phase out by 2015</li></ul><p>From 2008 the use of virgin HCFCs shall be prohibited in the
maintenance and servicing of air conditioning equipment.</p><p>The fourth convention on Climate Change will be held in
November in Buenos Aries and information on the Kyoto Protocol
may be found on the <a href="http://www.unfccc.de/">United
Nations climate change homepage</a>.</p><h3 id="emissions">Emissions Trading and Permits</h3><p>What is most likely to affect both the building owner and the
building service engineer as a direct result of Kyoto, is the
prospect of Emission Permits. The <span class="small-caps">US</span> is the main proponent of
emissions trading, this based on its own successes with companies
for whom sulphur emissions were a concern. Permits were allocated
to companies for sulphur emissions; this allocation being
tradeable on the open market. The opening prices for Sulphur
Emissions Permits when first issued were high but rapidly fell,
it is thought, for the two following reasons. Firstly, abatement
projects became more economical when the cost per ton abated was
less than the market price of an Emissions Permit. Secondly,
companies began to revise their thinking about the cost of
abatement measures when they themselves needed to buy an
emissions permit.</p><p>Similarly, it is supposed that building owners would have a
set of permits which cover green house gas emissions from their
buildings. The tradeable permit may perhaps only cost money at
the outset; very efficient companies may not need to have permits
or alternatively use them to their financial advantage by selling
them to other companies. What will be unfamiliar to all is that
the permit may well be a legal document in the future. Whereas it
has hitherto been considered by many countries in the past, that
the price of energy would have to become very high before
building owners took serious notice of energy efficient design,
the issuing of permits is likely to concentrate the building
owners mind a great deal more. Even if a permit system does not
embrace building owners other countries might devise a system
that does. One country for example may wish to release onto the
international emissions trading market the savings from replacing
the district heating schemes of entire cities.</p><p>The Kyoto meeting set out an ambitious agenda to tackle global
climate change and it is intended much of the detail needed to
turn it into law will be negotiated at the Buenos Aires meeting
in November 1998. What is certain is that the building owners and
developing countries in particular would do well to address the
issue now and have nothing to lose by this but much to gain. For
building service engineers throughout the world the Kyoto
Protocol provides a demanding and yet exciting challenge ahead.</p><hr class="mt-5"><h2 class="mt-5" id="freecooling">Free Cooling and Low Energy Systems</h2><p>Free cooling take place when the external ambient air enthalpy
(the term used for a combination of sensible heat and moisture
content) is less than the indoor air enthalpy and the cool
external air is transferred to the building envelope either
directly or indirectly. Surprisingly this is not taken advantage
of very widely in most countries of the world and of course the
efficacy of the external cool air would be increased when used in
modern buildings because of improved insulation values.</p><p>Free cooling may be used in conjunction with air systems and
hydraulic systems. This article discusses the use of free cooling
with air systems.</p><p>Air conditioning systems either provide supply air using</p><ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li>A mixture of outside air and recirculated air, or</li><li>100% outside air systems which are generally used in the
cases of hospitals, densely occupied areas such as
theatres etc. or increasingly there is a preference for
these systems as a matter of course in certain countries.</li></ol><h3 id="mixed">Free Cooling using Mixed Outside Air and
Recirculation Systems and Temperature and Enthalpy Control</h3><p>Free cooling may be used with mixed outside air and
recirculation systems by the use of modulating dampers. Dampers
are provided on the outside air intake ductwork, exhaust air
ductwork and the recirculation ductwork. In the event of cool
outside air the quantity of outside air is increased and the
quantity of recirculated air is reduced to provide the required
supply air temperature. In this way cooling by means of
refrigeration equipment is avoided altogether at certain times of
year and often at night times.</p><p>This system of free cooling is popular and uses thermostats to
determine when the outside air is cool and the proportion the
outside air damper should be opened by. More accurately the
proportion of outside air should be increased when the outside
air enthalpy is lower than the room enthalpy. In reality
temperature sensing is more popular because thermostats are less
costly and are less likely to drift out of calibration.</p><p>When the outside air temperature (alternatively enthalpy) is
higher than the room temperature (alternatively enthalpy) in
Summer the dampers will modulate to the minimum outside air
position to keep the load on the refrigeration equipment to a
minimum.</p><h4 id="additionalfreecooling">Additional Free Cooling using
Dew Point Control and Direct Humidifiers</h4><p>Further sensible cooling (reduction in temperature as
indicated on a thermometer) may be achieved by the use of
humidifiers which spray water into the air steam to cool the air.
This method of sensible cooling is extremely effective but became
less popular in the last decade or more because of Legionnaires&rsquo;
Disease. This form of cooling used to be provided by air washers
but the concern over Legionella meant that ultra-violet light and
other forms of biocide control had to be used in conjunction with
this equipment and added both capital costs and high maintenance
costs. In reality the industry turned to steam injection
humidifiers if humidification was required because there was no
risk at all with respect to Legionella. However steam injection
humidifiers do not provide any sensible cooling and in fact
provide a small amount of sensible heating and whilst they are
valuable tools for humidification are of no value for free
cooling.</p><h4 id="legionnaires">Consideration of Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease
and Humidifiers</h4><p>Legionella Pneumophila is ubiquitous in water and only
believed to be a problem when growth and therefore colonisation
takes place. This tends to happen in stagnant water and the water
temperature is typically between 20&deg;C and 45&deg;C. To be ingested
into the respiratory system the water must be absorbed in an
aerosol form.</p><p>Steam injection humidifiers became popular because all
bacteria were pasteurised although the benefit of sensible
cooling using spray coils was lost. Chemical biocides (bacteria
killing process) such as those that are chlorine and bromine
based are suitable for cooling towers, where sprays are also
used, but not suitable for supply air systems to occupied
buildings due to their toxicity. The options remaining were
therefore limited to biocides such as ultra-violet light (a
further possible option is the use of chlorine dioxide which is
soluble in water and claimed by the manufacturers to be harmless
when drunk).</p><p>Some of the new generation of water humidifiers address the
problems brought about by the concern for Legionella Pneumophila
and also provide sensible cooling and may be used for dew point
control.</p><dl><dt>Evaporative Humidifiers</dt><dd><p>These humidifiers spray water on to a matrix and water is
transmitted to the air stream through the saturated
matrix or corrugation. Provided the air velocity through
the matrix is limited to 1.75 m/s then the air velocity
is sufficiently low to prevent aerosols forming and they
are thought to be safe to use without regular biocide
treatment. The sump is generally sufficiently cold to
prevent the colonisation of Legionella and when the sump
water is not being used i.e. stagnant then the water
should be drained from the sump.</p></dd><dt>Ultra-sonic Humidifiers</dt><dd><p>Ultra-sonic humidifiers use transducers (devices that use
input energy to create a different form of output energy)
vibrating at a high frequency in water to create fine
aerosols. Manufacturers claim the ultrasonic shock acts
as a biocide.</p></dd><dt>Pneumatic Humidifiers</dt><dd><p>These are generally connected directly to the water
supply and compressed air is used to propel water through
nozzles to create a fine aerosol. Close humidity control
may be achieved by these humidifiers.</p></dd></dl><p>Of the three, the evaporative humidifier is likely to have the
lowest capital costs and may generally be used without biocides
for most applications.</p><h4 id="dewpoint">The Application in Practice of Dew Point
Control and Direct Humidifiers</h4><p>The use of the humidifiers described above, known as adiabatic
(constant enthalpy or heat energy) humidifiers, have the effect
of a useful reduction in dry bulb temperature whilst increasing
the air moisture content thus making no difference to the
enthalpy of the air. The dew point of air is the temperature of
saturated air i.e. air at 100% relative humidity and the dew
point temperature of air at less than 100% relative humidity will
always be lower than the dry bulb temperature and in this way
therefore the saturation of air with water vapour lowers the dry
bulb temperature by means of the process know as adiabatic
cooling which by definition is at constant enthalpy at 0&deg;C feed
water temperature. In reality and perhaps surprisingly the feed
water temperature does not make a significant difference to the
process. With feed water as high as 100&deg;C the water is
evaporated more quickly; this will cause a slight gain in
enthalpy.</p><p>This simple but effective method of lowering the dry bulb
temperature of the air has been practised for many years.</p><p>In Summer when the outdoor air enthalpy is higher than the
indoor ambient enthalpy then the modulating dampers would
modulate to minimum outside air and the humidifier would not be
used.</p><p>In Spring and Autumn when the outdoor enthalpy is lower than
the indoor enthalpy but is less than the required enthalpy for
sufficient indoor cooling, the dampers are modulated to the dew
point of the supply air and the humidifier saturates the air to
dew point. The air is then reheated if required to the supply air
temperature or may not require reheating if the condition of the
air after the humidifier is exactly as required to maintain room
conditions.</p><p>In Winter, when the outside air enthalpy is low, then the
modulating dampers would modulate to minimum position to achieve
the required dew point and the air reheated after the
humidification process to achieve the required supply air
condition. In very cold weather a preheater may be required.</p><p>The sensors required to achieve the above control are:</p><ol><li>Enthalpy or dry bulb sensor in the incoming outside air
duct.</li><li>Dew point sensor after the humidifier with the set point
at the required supply air moisture content.</li><li>Dry bulb sensor after the reheater to control the
required re-heat.</li><li>The set point of (3) may be scheduled against ambient
temperature or changes in response to the extract air
temperature by a dry bulb sensor in the return air duct.</li></ol><p>The method of control described is simple but is wasteful of
reheat because the intake air must be cooled to saturation point
to achieve the required dew point and then reheated to supply air
temperature. A more sophisticated control would be carried out
using a Building Energy Management System (<span class="small-caps">BEMS</span> system)
controlling both moisture content and enthalpy. As close humidity
control is required, a direct injection adiabatic humidifier
would normally be used with this form of control and installed
after the heating coil, in contrast to the control strategy
described previously when the humidifier would normally be
installed before the heating coil.</p><p>This method of control performs a series of logical tests at
points around the system for values of enthalpy and moisture
content to arrive at the most efficient control strategy and in
this way reduces the amount of reheat required.</p><p>When heating is required the dampers will modulate to the
required room moisture content and in this way reheat is reduced.</p><p>When cooling is required the dampers will modulate to the
required room enthalpy and the air then adiabatically humidified
to the required room supply air temperature.</p><p>For low enthalpy and moisture content conditions in Winter the
moisture content will not be in the range of the damper
modulation and in this event the air will require to be preheated
before humidification.</p><h3 id="outsideair">100% Outside air systems</h3><h4 id="heatrecovery">Outside Air Heat Recovery and Indirect
Evaporative Humidifiers</h4><p>A simple and yet effective way of providing free cooling is to
provide a heat recovery unit between the supply and exhaust duct
which is normal practice when using 100% outside air systems. An
evaporative humidifier (known as an indirect humidifier when
located in the return air duct) is then provided before the
exhaust connection to the heat recovery unit. Free cooling is
obtained whenever the external ambient temperature exceeds the
temperature in the exhaust duct after the evaporative humidifier.
This system has the advantage of sensible heat only being
transferred to the air stream and therefore moisture content is
not increased. When the external ambient temperature is lower
than the temperature after the evaporative humidifier then free
cooling would be provided from outside air and modulating dampers
used to allow the exhaust air to bypass the heat recovery unit.
This system is a low design risk option and although it will not
eliminate refrigeration entirely will considerably reduce the
size of plant required.</p><p>An example of an application in Asia is as follows and Mr
Dahliwal writes:</p><blockquote><p><span class="pull-double">&ldquo;</span>I had read your article on displacement ventilation and
found the scheme very useful for ventilating large buildings
having high sensible heat loads. I have applied the scheme
for ventilating a <span class="small-caps">DG</span> house, the data is reproduced here:</p><ul><li>Heat dissipation: 400kW</li><li>Cooling source: Indirect/direct evaporative cooling</li><li>Air Quantity: 40,000 <span class="small-caps">CFM</span> (18,200 litres/s)</li><li>Ambient <span class="small-caps">DB</span>: 41&deg;C</li><li>Supply Air: 21&deg;C</li><li>Room condition: 32&deg;C</li></ul><p>Normally in India the <span class="small-caps">DG</span> houses were ventilated by using
axial flow fans and accepted norm was to accept indoor temp.
exceeding 50&deg;C because the air quantities required to
achieve lower temp become uneconomic. The mixed flow
ventilation often provided air at 12 ft from the ground
level. This arrangement caused the work level temp to be
still higher.</p><p>With a combination of Indirect/Direct evaporative cooling
and displacement ventilation, we have been able to maintain
the floor level temp almost 7 to 8&deg;C below the ambient and
in addition the power saving have exceeded 75% when compared
with a mixed flow ventilation system capable of maintaining
temp above 7&deg;C above ambient.</p><p>This is our first job using displacement ventilation. We
are now looking at the possibility of applying this scheme in
textile spinning plant using a combination of Indirect/Direct
evap. cooling and chilled water spray humidifier.</p><p>Regards <br>    S.DHALIWAL</p><p>P.S. We are in the business of designing Indirect/direct
evap systems for industrial applications.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>By the application of indirect and direct evaporative cooling
and the use of displacement ventilation the engineer was able to
maintain a low level temperature of 7-8&deg;C below the external
ambient.</p><h3 id="desiccants">Desiccants</h3><p>Evaporative humidification is an extremely useful technology
particularly in hot dry climates and may also be used to reduce
the load on air conditioning equipment in damper climates. The
limitation of evaporative humidifiers is that the reduction in
dry bulb temperature is conditional on the moisture content of
the incoming air and as a result the use of desiccant wheels have
become increasingly popular as they are able to increase the
efficiency of the adiabatic process by reducing the air moisture
content prior to humidification.</p><p>The desiccant wheel dries the air and is usually used in
conjunction with a thermal wheel to transfer sensible heat from
the supply air duct. The system may not be considered as free
cooling as heat is required to regenerate the desiccants but may
be considered as low energy because in most climates evaporative
cooling is sufficient at certain times of year without the need
for drying by the desiccants.</p><h3 id="soliddesiccant">Solid Desiccant Systems</h3><p>Entering air to the system is dehumidified and heated by a
rotating desiccant wheel. The drier air then passes through a
sensible heat recovery wheel which reduces the dry bulb
temperature of the supply air without altering moisture content.
The dry bulb temperature of the air is reduced still further by
passing through an evaporative humidifier (called a direct
humidifier when installed in the supply duct) and in to the air
conditioned space. The evaporative humidifier increases the
moisture content of the air in proportion to reduction in dry
bulb temperature.</p><p>Return air is generally passed through another evaporative
humidifier where the return air temperature is reduced and
moisture content increased. This colder air is transferred via
the sensible heat recovery wheel, previously mentioned to the
supply air duct. The return air temperature is then further
increased by passing through a heater and the air temperature
elevated to a level sufficient to reactivate the desiccants in
the desiccant wheel in the return air section of the duct.</p><p>The use of heat for the regeneration process is the highest
energy requirement of the system. The elevated temperature of the
return air duct removes moisture from the desiccants and the
wheel will then absorb moisture again.</p><p>Typical desiccant reactivation temperatures required in the
return air duct for Europe are 70-80&deg;C and air will be exhausted
from the system at typically 40-50&deg;C. A proportion of return air
may bypass the heater and desiccant wheel in order to minimise
energy consumption.</p><p>Desiccant cooling is a potentially environmentally friendly
technology for cooling buildings particularly if solar energy is
used for the reactivation process. Research seems to indicate
that in Europe a hybrid system should be used to minimise
reactivation costs. This would consist of a desiccant ventilation
system cooling the incoming air and using solar/gas for
reactivation used in conjunction with low grade chilled water
from towers or better still purpose constructed ponds serving
ceiling chilled water coils providing sensible cooling and in
this way avoid vapour compression equipment altogether. It would
seem in a hot climate that it is possible that all of the cooling
could be provided by the desiccant system and solar energy and
this is likely to reduce capital costs, running costs and
maintenance costs considerably as well as avoid vapour
compression equipment.</p><h3 id="liquiddesiccants">Liquid Desiccants</h3><p>The desiccant system described previously uses solid
desiccants i.e. silica gel or lithium chloride; liquid desiccant
systems use a liquid spray of desiccant solution such as lithium
bromide. The development of liquid desiccant systems compared to
solid desiccant systems is still in its infancy although it is
claimed that liquid desiccant systems have the potential
advantage of better efficiency as dehumidification and heat
transfer take place simultaneously rather than sequentially.</p><p>The Genius 4000 has been developed in the <span class="small-caps">USA</span> by Albers Air
Conditioning and uses liquid desiccants to dehumidify outside air
or cool make up air without the need for conventional
refrigerants. The liquid desiccant in this system is composed of
90% lithium bromide and 10% lithium chloride. According to Albers
Air Conditioning, liquid desiccants do not deteriorate over time,
unlike solid desiccants. However, sulphur contaminants in the air
can combine with the desiccant to form lithium sulphate, which is
not a desiccant. Ablers claim that, as there are about 80 litres
in the machine, it would take a long time to reduce the desiccant
to a significant level. In dirty conditions Albers states that it
might prove necessary to change the desiccant as part of an
annual service, although the regeneration process tends to remove
most of the pollutants.</p><p>Performance figures, taken from the manufacturer&rsquo;s tests at
outside conditions of 28&deg;C dry bulb and 50% relative humidity
give 37 <span class="small-caps">KW</span> of gross cooling, air being supplied to the room at
11.4C. A room condition of 23&deg;C dry bulb and 55% relative
humidity was used in calculating the capacity and the cooling
capacity would increase at higher temperatures and humidities.
Primary energy use for the Genius is said to be typically 30%
less than conventional vapour compression equipment and
approximately halves the operating costs. The system would be
best suited for systems with high outside air requirements and
would have to be used in conjunction with other equipment for
high internal sensible loads although this may not necessarily be
the case if used in conjunction with a Termodeck (see later)
system which does much to mitigate the effect of high internal
sensible heat gains.</p><h3 id="thermal">Thermal Energy Storage, Phase Change and
Eutectic Chemicals</h3><p>When using desiccants for cooling, as the reheat required for
the regeneration of the desiccants is by far the highest single
energy cost, it makes sense to mitigate these costs as far as
possible. Solar energy may be stored by the use of phase change
material which raise the melting point and boiling point of a
chemical solution using Eutectic salts. The thermal energy stored
is released back in to the system when required and in this way
provides free reheat at certain times.</p><p>Thermal energy storage may be used for storing either cool
energy or heat energy and the appropriate phase change material
selected for the particular application. Many countries offer
cheap rate electricity costs at night to even electricity demand
and therefore cool energy may be stored at night for use the
following day with the resulting economy.</p><h3 id="alternative">Alternative Methods of Cooling and
Reducing Cooling Loads and Energy Costs</h3><h4 id="night">Night Cooling</h4><p>The use of a building as a heat sink to absorb heat in
occupied hours and then followed by night cooling has shown to be
beneficial.</p><p>A much used technique is to have cool night air pass over a
slab and in this way cool the slab at night. The warmer daytime
air will be reduced in temperature when passing over the cooled
slab and help to reduce the daytime peak load. It is clear that
during hot weather it would probably always be helpful for night
time cooling to take place and the control strategy would be
simple. The control strategy to be used for quite hot days is
less obvious because the energy consumed by the running of a fan
at night as against the energy saved by slab cooling may be
marginal or counter-productive. In a predominantly hot climate
the strategy for night cooling would be reasonably simple but in
a temperate climate is less clear. On site tests carried out by
the Building Service Research Association in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> have
suggested the following strategy:</p><p>That night time cooling should be initiated if any or a
combination of the following occur:</p><ul><li>Peak indoor zone temperature exceeds <span class="small-caps">23C</span></li><li>Average zone indoor temperature exceeds <span class="small-caps">22C</span></li><li>Average afternoon outdoor temperature is higher than
20C</li></ul><p>They also conclude that night time cooling should continue to
be used if all of the following criteria occur:</p><ul><li>The indoor zone temperature is higher than the outside
air temperature +2C</li><li>The indoor zone temperature is higher than indoor heating
set point.</li><li>The outside air temperature is higher than <span class="small-caps">12C</span></li></ul><p>The night cooling would be carried out seven days a weeks
during the unoccupied periods of the building and once the
criteria are not satisfied then night cooling would continue to
operate for an additional two nights providing night cooling has
taken place for the previous five nights.</p><p>A minimum set point should be provided to prevent overcooling
otherwise re-heating would be required and therefore be
counter-productive.</p><p>When using a mechanically ventilated building for night
cooling then the exhaust fan should be preferred to avoid
temperature pick up from the supply fan (unless the supply fan
motor is out of the air stream) and a minimum air velocity of 1.5
m/s. It may even be worth considering the installation of a night
cooling bypass duct which would bypass the main plant to avoid
pressure drop and minimise fan energy; in order that less energy
is used then the fan would need to be a variable speed fan or at
least a two speed fan.</p><p>There is a possibility in certain climates that the
temperature of the slab when cooled could cause condensation and
this should be safe guarded against by the use of a moisture
detector on the slab or other means.</p><p>It is estimated in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> that internal temperatures can
typically be held at 6-8&deg;C below peak external summer time
temperatures and in hotter climates particularly where there is a
sharp contrast between Summer day temperatures and Summer night
temperatures the reduction would be considerably more.</p><p>Consideration should be given to the slab at the design stage
and in order to increase the exposed area of the slab a coffered
or sinusoidal shape is advantageous. It has been demonstrated the
effective rate of heat flow between the internal surface of a
construction and the space temperature is the limiting factor to
achieving heat storage rather than the thickness of the slab.
(The maximum slab thickness required appears to be up to
approximately 100mm.) In order to maximise the heat flow
relationship it is concluded that mechanical ventilation should
be used, the heatflow is further enhanced by ducting air through
hollow cores in precast concrete slabs and the best heat flow was
achieved by ducting supply air close to the slab surface beneath
steel sheeting.</p><h4 id="termodeck">TermoDeck Passive Temperature Control
Systems</h4><p>The Swedish developed TermoDeck system uses the slab as both a
structural component and also a means of ducting ventilation
through the building through oval or round shaped holes within
the concrete structure. Over 200 projects have been installed in
Sweden and Norway and latterly Holland and Belgium.</p><p>With the TermoDeck systems the slab temperature is very close
to the room temperature and makes it suitable for displacement
ventilation as well as mixed flow ventilation (see later for
comparison of displacement and mixed flow). In Summer the supply
air fans at night bring in the cool air into the hollow slabs to
cool the building and the warm outside air is cooled in the
daytime.</p><p>Two systems have recently been installed in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and the
latest building The Elizabeth Fry Building uses mechanical
ventilation with heating and no mechanical cooling at all. Mixed
flow ventilation is used throughout the building except the
Lecture Theatre where displacement ventilation is used. The
building has created much interest and is being closely monitored
for energy consumption and occupant satisfaction by the PROBE
team (independent organisation monitoring buildings after
occupation). The slab temperature is kept at 22&deg;C with a
deadband of 1/2&deg;C for heating and 1.5&deg;C for cooling.
TermoDeck&rsquo;s inventor Loa Anderson predicts with computer
modelling that at an external peak of 29&deg;C the peak internal
temperature should not rise above 26&deg;C with a daily average room
temperature around <span class="small-caps">22C</span>.</p><p>The <span class="small-caps">PROBE</span> team conclude that of 12 recently constructed
buildings in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> this building had the highest occupant
comfort scores and are also recorded the highest comfort scores
recorded by the independent survey specialists Building Use
Studies. Typical energy consumption for heating and ventilation
for the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> are around 200 kWh/msq./y and for Sweden using
TermoDeck between 30-50 kWh/msq./y, this building seems to be
following the Swedish trend.</p><p>The TermoDeck system has since been installed in hot climates
such as Saudi Arabia where the slab tends to be kept at a
temperature of <span class="small-caps">19C</span>. The manufacturers claim that the cooling
plant capacity and associated equipment is substantially reduced
and the Elizabeth Fry research appears to confirm significantly
reduced cooling loads and running costs.</p><p>The system may be used with mixed flow or displacement
ventilation, night cooling, free cooling, desiccant cooling,
packaged equipment cooling, <span class="small-caps">DX</span> equipment, chilled water equipment
and so is versatile.</p><p>As the room temperature and slab temperature are similar the
room temperature tends to be uniform and therefore assists
comfort.</p><h4 id="barra">The Barra System</h4><p>This system was developed by Horazio Barra in Italy and
originally used as a passive solar heating system. Floors of
reinforced concrete are used with embedded channels utilising
hollow concrete blocks. Outdoor air is blown through the channels
and when originally used the hot air emerging from the insulated
southern facing collecting wall served as thermal storage. The
system may be modified and used as a cooling system as well. At
night a fan blows ambient air through the channels and thus cold
night energy will be stored within the ceiling mass.</p><p>During the daytime the cooled ceiling will absorb the heat
from the interior space passively.</p><h4 id="roofs">Roofs, Roof Ponds and the Soil</h4><p>In his book <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Passive and Low Energy Cooling of
Buildings&rsquo;</cite> Professor Baruch Givoni describes methods of
cooling using the above.</p><p>As roofs are usually insulated to minimise both heat loss and
external heat gain it is not possible to take advantage of low
nocturnal temperature unless the roof is designed in a certain
way. A simple method of achieving radiant cooling is to use a
heavy but highly conductive roof exposed to the sky at night
which would be highly insulated in the day using operable
insulation although it is the opinion of Professor Givoni that
practical and movable insulation is not available at present.
Several buildings in the United States have used the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Skytherm&apos;
system in which the roof is made of structural steel deck plates.
Plastic bags filled with water are placed above the steel decks
and above them are movable insulation panels that are moved by a
motor. In Winter the water bags are exposed to the sun in the day
and covered by the insulation panels at night. In Summer when
cooling is required the water bags are exposed and cooled at
night and insulated during the daytime. As the cooled water bags
are in direct contact with the metal deck the ceiling serves as a
cooling element over the entire space. However it is the opinion
of Professor Givoni that the availability of a simple and trouble
free system of movable insulation is still in question.</p><p>In contrast to using indirect and direct evaporative cooling
in conjunction with air being introduced into a building and as
previously described it is possible to cool a roof by placing a
cooled pond over it. The building is then cooled by conduction
across the roof which lowers indoor air and radiant temperatures
without increasing the indoor water vapour content.</p><p>Professor Givoni suggests the ceiling temperature in the case
of a concrete roof over a well insulated building would be about
2&deg;C above the water temperature. It is concluded that the water
temperature of a shaded pond follows approximately the average
wet bulb temperature. The suggested maximum wet bulb temperature
for applications of this type of evaporative cooling in summer is
22-24&deg;C and the dry bulb temperature not higher than 42-44C.</p><p>A shaded pond or lake adjacent to a building will provide cool
water to fan coil units or similar within a building and will
provide useful cooling in hot climates. For a more detailed
appraisal of this subject and calculations see Nick Pines website
detailed at the end of this article. An indirect heat exchanger
submerged in the water could be used and in this way cold water
circulated to a closed loop system perhaps connected to mass
produced fan coil units or other terminals. A submersible pump in
the pond would be used to circulate water within the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>open&rsquo; loop
using a stainless steel fine mesh filter say of 20 micron to keep
the heat exchanger clean, a submersed non-corrosive carbon fibre
heat exchanger would best be used for separating the open and
closed circuits. If the water were taken directly from the pond
to the fan coil, problems of corrosion and salt build up would
probably make this at best a temporary measure even if the water
was well filtered.</p><p>Professor Givoni in his book suggests a number of methods of
using the soil as a cooling source stating that in temperate
climates at a depth of 2 to 3 metres the natural temperature of
the soil could be enough to serve as a cooling source but in hot
climates the soil temperature is usually too high. However there
are simple methods to lower the soil temperature such as covering
the soil with mulch at least 10cm thick and in regions with dry
climates irrigating it, or raising the building off the ground
and allowing water that was provided by either summer rains or
irrigation to evaporate from the shaded soil surface.</p><p>Once cooled the reduced soil temperature may be used in a
variety of ways for both passive and active cooling.</p><h4 id="lithium">Liquid Lithium Chloride Absorption System
Using Solar Energy</h4><p>In a paper entitled <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Unglazed collector/regenerator
performance for a solar assisted open cycle absorption cooling
system&apos;</cite> the following research was described:</p><blockquote><p><span class="pull-double">&ldquo;</span>A black shingled roof was used as a collector/regenerator
for the evaporation of water to obtain a strong solution of
lithium chloride absorbent. In the house, water (the
refrigerant) is sprayed into an evaporator and this was
evacuated to a pressure of about 5mm of mercury where the
water immediately flashes into vapour. Cold water pumped from
the bottom of the evaporator then flowed through a fan coil
unit which blew cold air into the area requiring cooling.
(Fan coil units are usually used with chilled water in the
HVAC industry). Water vapour from the evaporator flows over
the absorber where it is absorbed by the concentrated
absorbent (lithium chloride). The continuous absorption of
water vapour maintained a low pressure in the system and
permitted flashing of water in the evaporator. The product of
the absorption process which was a weak absorbent solution
collected at the bottom of the absorber to be pumped over the
roof for concentration.</p><p>The dilute lithium chloride solution was delivered to the
collector surface through a spray header spanning the top of
the roof and made from 2 inch <span class="small-caps">PVC</span> pipe fitted with 35 evenly
spaced nozzles. The concentrated solution collected at the
bottom in a <span class="small-caps">PVC</span> rain gutter and returned via gravity to a 425
gallon tank&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p>The Authors demonstrated a regeneration efficiency of between
38 and 67% which corresponds to a cooling capacity range of from
31kW to 72kW (8.8-20 tons of refrigeration). This is about 3.5kW
per 10 metres square or 1 ton per 100 foot squared of roof area.</p><p>The costs of the chemicals used in this research are
insignificant.</p><p>These remarkable results indicate that at peak conditions a
roof say of 10m x 10m (100square metres or approx. 1000square
feet) could provide 35kW (10 tons) of cooling for very little
energy costs.</p><p>If the system was used to provide cold water to a heat
exchanger which then had cold air blown through to say a passive
Termodeck ventilation system in the building then during hot
weather in many buildings it is possible that further cooling may
not be required at all and, of course, the running costs would be
minimal.</p><p>This research should not be lost on building owners and
building service designers particularly in hot climates and it is
quite possible that the research could further point the way to
low energy design in the future.</p><h3 id="choices">Practical Choices for Free Cooling and Low
Energy Systems</h3><p>Clearly the application of free cooling and low energy cooling
to a building is an extremely complex choice.</p><h4 id="dispvmixed">Displacement vs Mixed Flow</h4><p>If the building is high enough for a displacement effect to
take place and has a high sensible gain, then this will minimise
the cooling capacity required, especially if the heat gain is at
high level where much of the heat may be exhausted at source.
With a room of 2.3 metres height and below, a displacement effect
will not take place so it would be counter-productive to use
displacement terminals; in fact, a higher room volume of air
would be required as the cooling supply air room temperatures
would have to be higher than for high level mixed flow
distribution.</p><p>For a more detailed appraisal of the type of air distribution
see the article titled <a id="dmf" href="displacement_vs_mixed_flow_ventilation.html"><cite><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Consideration
of Displacement Ventilation vs Mixed Flow Ventilation for
Building Owner/Designers&rsquo;</cite></a>.</p><h4 id="minoutsideair">Consideration of Minimum Outside Air
Quantities and Odour Control</h4><p>The outside air sensible and latent cooling load may well be
one of the largest single loads imposed on cooling plant for an
air conditioned building and so is here considered in some
detail.</p><p>There is no question that both the quantity and quality of
outside air are crucial to the comfort of occupants in air
conditioned buildings and the efficacy of the air conditioning of
an entire building when related to comfort may be negated by the
introduction of too little or poor quality outside air. Of course
when designing low energy buildings there is a pressure to
minimise outdoor air in order to keep plant size small and
running costs low. This subject has therefore been the recipient
of a huge amount of research throughout the world since the
inception of modern air conditioning and is as important now as
it has ever been particularly as modern buildings are becoming
more<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>tight&rsquo; and outdoor air quality, in particular in urban
areas, poorer in quality.</p><p>The trend in Scandinavia and more recently in Canada are for
low energy buildings&nbsp;- and yet using 100% outside and
exhaust air with heat recovery from the exhausted air, this may
well point the way for the future particularly in temperate
climates. Even in urban areas with poor quality outdoor air the
use of good carbon filters, electrostatic filters and/or HEPA
filters will improve the quality of the air immeasurably.</p><p>Clearly if 100% of the air circulated through a building is
from outside this would impose the maximum cooling load on
cooling plant when the external ambient is hot and humid. Before
useful cooling of the building is to be achieved the cooling
plant has to reduce both the external dry bulb and moisture
content to room conditions before the cooling plant provides
useful indoor cooling and this will reflect both on the cooling
plant size and the running costs. Alternatively the other extreme
is if the system recirculates 100% of the air and in a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>tight&apos;
building the outside air would exert little influence on the
building cooling loads during peak conditions and this would
reflect in smaller cooling plant being required and lower running
costs.</p><p>In reality a minority only of air conditioned buildings use
either of these extremes.</p><p>It is instructive to look back briefly at a some of the
history of outside air research in order to appreciate the
present day situation.</p><p>Outdoor air is needed to meet the oxygen needs of occupants,
the dilution of odours, contaminants and gases in particular
carbon dioxide. The early work of Yaglou et al in 1936 provided
the benchmark throughout most of the world for many years and
this was based on work in American schools and determined the
quantity of outside air needed to provide a satisfactory
reduction of odours depending both on the number of people
present and personal hygiene. This research determined that for
the same volume of air that odours dispersed more rapidly when
each occupied a greater volume of the room air. The guidelines
for many years were therefore directly related to the quantity of
outside air per occupant and consideration was also given to the
likely concentration of the occupants.</p><p>The minimum outdoor air quantities in the 1980s of 5 litres/s
and 2.5 litres/s per person adopted by the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and North America
respectively were shown to be inadequate by laboratory based work
of Leaderer, B P and Cain<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Air quality in buildings during
smoking and non-smoking occupancy&apos;. The work demonstrated that
the ventilation rates were inadequate when considering odour
levels perceived by people when first entering an already
occupied space and that the density of occupancy had no bearing
on fresh air requirements. Minimum air quantities were then
increased in both countries to 8 litres/second in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and to
7.5 litres/sec per person in North America.</p><p>These figures were recommended particularly because of concern
over the incidence of ventilation related problems in air
condition buildings and based on the work of the aforementioned
Leaderer et al. and also the work of P.O Fanger<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Body odour and
carbon dioxide, minimum ventilation rates&rsquo;.</p><p>The work of P.O. Fanger, J. Lauridsen, P. Bluyssen and G
Clausen <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Air pollution sources in offices and assembly
halls, quantified by the Olf unit&apos;</cite> addressed the question
of ventilation rates and the relationship with a unit of odour
intensity called the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Olf&apos;. In this important work a large number
of people were subjected to odour levels in a variety of
naturally and mechanically ventilated buildings and air
conditioned spaces. The research found that for every occupant
and associated odour there may be another four to five odour
equivalents (olfs) released from building materials, furnishings
and the air handling system.</p><p>Auditoria are particularly thought to be prone to soiling of
internal surfaces because of the extent of soft furnishings and
acoustically absorbent finishes.</p><h3 id="odour">The Units of Odour Intensity</h3><p>The contribution to the industry of the work of Professor
Fanger and his team in Denmark has been immense. Not only did
Professor Fanger develop his well known<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>comfort equation&apos;, which
was developed empirically and contains the many variables known
to make up the comfort of people, but as well as other work also
developed the concept of the units of odour&nbsp;- the olf and
the decipol. The nature of indoor pollution is very difficult to
assess because of the many indoor chemicals involved. Even for
pollutants that may be detected because of their odour or
irritation effect there is the issue of who should be the judge
of what is acceptable. Within buildings pollutants come from many
sources such as the building and furnishing materials and
chemicals such as correction fluid or from equipment such as
photocopiers.</p><p>Hundreds of volatile organic compounds have been identified in
indoor air and most seem to be much lower than for occupational
standards for industrial workers although little appears to be
known of the effects of long term exposure. The sheer complexity
of measuring indoor pollution raises the question of people
themselves being used as the test instrument. The use of
questionnaires given to building occupants for identifying and
assessing problems with indoor environment has been established
for some time. The approach of using a panel of assessors to
judge air quality has been advocated by Professor Fanger and has
given rise to the empirical units of the olf and the decipol. One
olf is defined as the air pollution produced by one<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>standard&apos;
person (a standard person is also defined) and a decipol is
defined as the perceived air pollution level in a space in which
there is a source strength of one olf and which is ventilated at
10 litres/second with unpolluted air. The proposed European air
quality standard <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>prENV 1752 Ventilation for buildings:
design criteria for the indoor environment&apos;</cite> often referred
to as the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Fanger Standard&rsquo; and at least 7 years in the making
has failed to be adopted by Europe as it was not endorsed by 71%
of the 17 participating countries. The proposed standard is
however a useful guide and has much valuable information although
the assessment of outside air quantities based on the use of the
olf and decipol is the subject of the greatest controversy.</p><p>Standards which deal explicitly with air quality for the
general populace in Europe and the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> are:</p><ul><li>World Health Organisation <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Air quality guidelines

the calculation of a dilution rate based on limiting
concentrations for non-industrial exposure to
contaminants. The Standard uses ambient air quality standards
produced by the <span class="small-caps">US</span> Environmental Protection Agency as a basis for
their definition of fresh air. This specifies exposure limits for
common pollutants and if examination of records shows that these
are exceeded then it is recommended that suitable air cleaning
apparatus be installed. It also introduced a technique for
determining the lead and lag time depending on the room volume
per person and their fresh air allowance.</p><p>Since there is potential for a wide diversity in pollutant
sources, contaminant types and population susceptibility to
pollutants, it is stressed that compliance with Standard 62 does
not ensure acceptable indoor air quality for everyone.</p><p>The Standard is under constant review but major revisions to
the Standard in 1996 which were to include the adoption of the
olf and decipol unit of measurement were abandoned. It is
understood that the Standard will be progressively updated as
firm data on odour emerges.</p><h3 id="trends">Future Trends for Outside Air Quantities and
Cooling Load Implications</h3><p>There appears to be a trend in Europe that the lead of the
Scandinavians is being followed of a tendency to use 100% outside
and exhaust air systems. Of course in a temperate climate this
would mean that<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>free cooling&rsquo; would be provided for much of the
year using very simple control. As heat exchanger efficiencies
are being increased and simple and inexpensive methods of cooling
are used then the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>knee jerk&rsquo; reaction to minimise outside air
may cease to be so important. The indoor air quality within a
building using 100% outside air and exhaust air and a well
filtered system would unquestionably provide optimum indoor air
quality especially if used in conjunction with displacement
ventilation removing contaminants etc. from the occupied zone.</p><p>In hot climates too, the prospect of introducing 100% outside
and exhausting 100% air at peak conditions may also be less
daunting using efficient heat exchangers. When supplying 100%
outside air at typical climate design conditions of say 47&deg;C dry
bulb and 24&deg;C wet bulb with return air of say 25&deg;C dry bulb at
55% <span class="small-caps">RH</span> with the use of a thermal wheel and an indirect evaporator
the incoming dry bulb temperature could be reduced to as little
as a 1.0&deg;C increase above the return air temperature. (i.e.
supply air dry bulb would be 26.0C&nbsp;- the figures assume 94%
efficiency for the humidifier and 75% efficiency for the thermal
wheel.) This figure seems perhaps surprisingly, low, particularly
as in hot climates the outdoor air load is often calculated to be
the largest single cooling requirement, especially if there is a
large outside air requirement due to high occupancies. But as may
be seen the sensible outside air load is almost reduced to zero.</p><p>If the air then passes through a cooling coil supplied with
low grade cooling water at 15&deg;C and having a sensible to total
ratio of 0.38 then the off coil would be 19&deg;C dry bulb and
18.89&deg;C wet bulb. These temperatures are ideal for displacement
ventilation and it is possible that no further cooling would be
required.</p><p>In a more humid climate say at 45&deg;C dry bulb and 31&deg;C wet
bulb a similar process could be followed but desiccants used to
reduce the wet bulb temperature of the incoming air.</p><h4 id="existing">Existing Buildings&nbsp;- the
Retrospective Addition of Cooling</h4><p>Generally the simplest, least disruptive and most used method
of providing cooling to an existing building is to use mass
produced mixed flow direct expansion equipment but with much of
this equipment there is little opportunity to provide free or low
energy cooling.</p><p>An option to consider would be to provide air handling
equipment with modulating dampers for free cooling using enthalpy
or temperature control as described previously. Even the most
temperate climates are likely to require further cooling at high
external ambient temperatures in Summer and the addition of
indirect and direct evaporative humidifiers should therefore be
considered. If further cooling is required then desiccant systems
with heat recovery and solar regeneration should be considered
perhaps using phase change equipment in hot countries. Research
seems to indicate that in Europe in order to minimise
regeneration costs then the use of ceiling coils providing
sensible cooling and using low grade pond water or if that is not
practical, cooling water directly from towers.</p><h4 id="new">New Buildings</h4><p>There are many more choices and options when designing
building services as part of the design team for a new buildings.
The thrust of this article is, in particular, directed at
buildings with high internal sensible loads.</p><p>Clearly everything should be done to mitigate the effect of
the high sensible load such as designing the height of rooms so
that displacement ventilation may be used and if possible remove
internal sensible gain at source or high level and it therefore
does not become part of the cooling load. This would be
particularly effective in buildings such as television studios
and displacement ventilation has the advantage of being able to
achieve very low noise levels as the outlet velocity from the
terminals is so low. A suitably silenced displacement system
could achieve down to Noise Criteria (<span class="small-caps">NC</span>) 10 and this has been
achieved at the well known Air Studio in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>, it is not
practical to achieve such a low noise level with mixed flow
ventilation as higher velocities are required for the throw of
the air. In reality <span class="small-caps">NC</span> 10 is an extraordinary low sound criteria
for an air conditioning system and most studios even with live
microphone applications are only designed to <span class="small-caps">NC20</span> which is still
a very low sound criteria. (&apos;Talking book&rsquo; studios are an
exception because of the pause between words and a lower sound
criteria is therefore often required). For further information on
air conditioning for studios and sound control see <cite><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span></cite><a id="studios" href="air_conditioning_design_for_studios.html"><cite>Practical Ventilation and Air
Conditioning Design for Studios, Control Rooms and Auditoria</cite></a><cite><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span></cite>.</p><p>The use of passive cooling could be considered at an early
stage such as the use of TermoDeck or the use of heat sinks such
as roof ponds and the soil.</p><p>Air handling equipment would be likely to be provided with
modulating dampers for free cooling using enthalpy or temperature
control, indirect and direct humidifiers and desiccant systems
with solar regeneration in hot countries and all as described
under the previous headings. With high occupancy buildings such
as Auditoriums or Concert Halls it is probable that a 100%
outside air will be required in which case it is essential to use
heat recovery equipment. There appears to be little doubt that
low level displacement ventilation is the way forward with high
occupancy buildings such as these and the trend appears to be the
positioning of terminals at each seat for occupant adjustment and
control&nbsp;- this design was used in the recently refurbished
Glyndebourne Opera House in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>.</p><p>As stated previously the design should be used to augment the
bioclimate architectural design of the building.</p><p>As fundamental decisions have to be taken for the efficacious
application of low energy design for new or refurbished buildings
it is clearly essential that the building service designer should
be consulted from the outset.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>An intriguing question is, just why is it that refrigeration
equipment quite often as big as a house and often constantly
energised is used to cool a medium sized office block in a
temperate climate let alone a hot climate. Willis Carrier the
father of modern air conditioning industry and whose name the
largest manufacturer in the world still bares, used the simple
expedient of passing air over ice to effectively cool a print
works. The answer possibly is that is simply the way the industry
evolved with the simplicity of the application of modern and at
the time universally acclaimed<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>friendly&rsquo; refrigerants in much the
same way as petrol driven engines evolved rather than steam
driven engines or the aeroplane rather than the airship.</p><p>Energy in the past and still today in some countries was just
not an issue. But now in the <span class="small-caps">HVAC</span> industry, it has not been
financial resources that has concentrated the mind but the
criticism of the use of energy and damage to the earths
environment. Whatever your point of view this has regardless set
a challenge to the modern <span class="small-caps">HVAC</span> engineer and the status quo is
unlikely to be maintained simply by finding of the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>holy grail&apos;
of a totally benign<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>drop in&rsquo; replacement for the ubiquitous HCFC
known as <span class="small-caps">R22</span>. In many peoples view the industry is changing
forever and if it is that a hospital in a poor hot country
through simple cost effective and simply maintainable engineering
is the benefactor then that has to be wonderful. It is no
different to what engineers have had to address through the ages
that a change of circumstances has been a pressure to re-think
and innovate and that surely is the exciting challenge to our
industry.</p><hr class="mt-5"><h2 id="acks">Acknowledgements</h2><p>Many thanks for information from Nick Pine of Nick Pine
