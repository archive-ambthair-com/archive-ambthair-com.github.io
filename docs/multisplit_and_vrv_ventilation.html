world and it is important that the designer&nbsp;/ specifier&nbsp;/ building owner has some practical
understanding of their uses and limitations.   These type of systems vary considerably
from manufacturer to manufacturer particularly with reference to noise levels and the
type of indoor units used.   This is particularly the case with <span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems where it is
often assumed, quite erroneously, that there are few manufacturers of these systems
and they are all similar&nbsp;- this is not the case.</p><p>The above systems have come of age in the last 5-10 years and are particularly
popular because they require less outdoor plant space than conventional systems, are
less disruptive to fit in existing buildings (particularly when occupied), are able to cool
and heat through common pipework and in the case of <span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems have inherent
heat recovery.</p><p>These systems all use refrigerant as the cooling&nbsp;/ heating medium rather than chilled
water&nbsp;/ hot water as is used in conventional hydraulic systems circulated by pumps.</p><p>Condensing units are used externally when cooling only is required and heat pumps are
used externally when both cooling and heating are required.</p><h2 id="multi">Multi-split Systems</h2><p>The traditional<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>split system&rsquo; is also known colloquially and more descriptively as a
&apos;one to one split system&apos;, meaning one external condensing unit&nbsp;/ heat pump is
connected by refrigerant pipework to one indoor cooling&nbsp;/ cooling and heating unit.</p><p>The multi-split system uses one external unit which is connected to several indoor
units.   The multi-split system takes a number of different forms and it is essential the
designer&nbsp;/ specifier understands the limitations of each type of system.</p><dl><dt>Master and slave system</dt><dd><p>One off external condensing unit&nbsp;/ heat pump unit is connected to several indoor units as
is typical for a mult-split system.   One of the indoor units is provided with
temperature controller&nbsp;/ sensor and acts as master and the other unit(s) acts as slaves.
All indoor units will therefore function as the master setting.   Master and slave units
are suitable for single areas, single rooms or even multiple rooms with very similar heat
gains&nbsp;/ losses.   They are not suitable for individual areas&nbsp;/ rooms which have different
heat gain&nbsp;/ loss characteristics because the master control will sense air temperature for
one area&nbsp;/ room only and the areas&nbsp;/ rooms will overcool or overheat.</p></dd><dt>Zoned control units</dt><dd><p>As previously one off external&nbsp;/ heat pump unit is connected to several indoor unit.
With these systems each indoor unit has its own individual temperature controller and
thus each unit functions as required to maintain the individual room temperature.
With these systems whilst there is individual control the limitation is that if cooling is
required in one area it is not possible to provide heating in a different area served by
the same system because the compressors will function in only cooling mode or heating
mode.</p></dd><dt>Variable refrigerant volume (<span class="small-caps">VRV</span>) systems</dt><dd><p>Again one off condensing unit/heat pump is connected to several indoor units.   VRV
systems are able to provide total versatility and each indoor unit may cool&nbsp;/ heat
independently of each other.   In fact, if part of a building requires cooling and other
areas require heating the heat rejected for the required cooling contributes or is
recovered to provide heating in the other area.</p></dd></dl><h2 id="refrigerant">Refrigerant Pipework Limitations</h2><p>The maximum lengths of pipework it is possible to use for all mass produced
refrigeration equipment is determined by the the compressor.   All<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>split&rsquo; systems
therefore have a maximum vertical and total refrigeration pipework length allowable.
This is a considerable disadvantage compared with hydraulic systems which are
pumped and as the pump may be sized to suit the system, then theoretically, the
hydraulic pipework may be run almost infinite distances.   It is important the
designer&nbsp;/ building owner is aware of these limitations.   Each manufacturer specifies
both the size of the pipework required for their system and the maximum permissible
vertical and total refrigerant pipework runs.</p><p>Moreover it may <em>not</em> be assumed that these distances will be similar between
manufacturers for similar capacity equipment this is often not the case.
However a nominal guideline is as follows:</p><ul><li>Up to 5 kW of cooling maximum of 25 metres</li><li>Up to 7 kW of cooling maximum of 25 metres to 50 metres (varies widely between
manufacturers)</li><li>Up to 15 kW of cooling maximum of 30 metres to 50 metres</li></ul><p><span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems and zoned systems generally up to 50 metres vertically and 100mm
overall.  Typically one outdoor unit may be connected to up to a maximum of 8 indoor
units.</p><p>(Some manufacturers produces a zoned system which allows up to 16 indoor units to
be connected to one outdoor unit.)</p><h2 id="indoor">Indoor Units</h2><p>All indoor units used with multi-split systems provide air distribution by mixed flow
and come in various forms:</p><ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li>Floor standing units</li><li>Units mounted on walls at high level</li><li>Unit mounted below a ceiling</li><li>Cassette units which recess within a false ceiling and terminate with a grille flush
with the false ceiling  through which air is supplied and exhausted to the space.</li><li>Ducted units or<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>void pack&rsquo; units mounted above a false ceiling and are generally
connected to ductwork terminating in the ceiling with supply and exhaust grilles to the
space.  These ducted units may take the form of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>low static&rsquo; pressure units or<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>high
static&rsquo; pressure units.</li></ol><p>With reference to (e), the size and type of the fan motors in these units  vary considerably from
manufacturer to manufacturer and this determines the extent of the ductwork allowable
which is a function of the static pressure of the fan.  Silencers may also be provided
within the ductwork for very low noise levels required in such spaces as recording
studios, but again the fan static pressure available has to be checked carefully so the
pressure drop through the silencers may be overcome by the fan.</p><h2 id="outside">Outside Air</h2><p>The introduction of outside air to all<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>split&rsquo; systems is often a problem (typically 8 L/S
per person is required).   To overcome this some manufacturers provide a heat recovery
unit which provides outside air to the air conditioned space independently of the indoor
units.   With these systems an equal quantity of outside air and exhaust air is supplied
and then exhausted from the air conditioned space.   The supply and exhaust air passes
over a heat exchanger so heat is recovered from the exhaust air and used to heat or
cool the outside air.   This solution has the limitation that air is introduced to the space
at two different temperatures, i.e. that of the indoor unit and that of the heat recovery
unit.  If possible it is always ideal to introduce outside air to the indoor unit.   It is
possible to introduce outside air to the following indoor units:</p><dl><dt>Cassette units</dt><dd><p>Some manufacturers provide cut outs on the side of the unit so outside air may be
ducted into the side of the unit above the false ceiling.   The length of the outside duct
has to be carefully considered and if over a certain length may have to be fan assisted.
Most manufacturers publish maximum permissible lengths and&nbsp;/ or pressure drops.  As
the outside air will bypass the cassette filter the ductwork should also be provided with
a filter.</p></dd><dt>Ducted unit</dt><dd><p>Provision may always be made for introducing outside air into the return air ductwork.</p></dd></dl><h2 id="applications">Applications</h2><p>The application of multi-split, zoned and <span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems should be carefully
considered.   Whilst the <span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems are the most versatile the capital outlay for the
equipment is far higher than for the other systems.</p><dl><dt>Multi-split and zoned systems</dt><dd><p>With most of these systems generally it is possible to provide individual control to each
indoor unit (the exception being the master and slave system previously described).
The sensor will provide cooling or heating as and when required to maintain the set
point temperature selected.</p><p>The systems are therefore applicable when there is a clearly defined heating and
cooling season i.e. cooling only required throughout the building or heating only
required throughout the building.  With the increased prevalence of heat producing I.T.
equipment within buildings this needs some consideration because if one particular part
of a building requires cooling 12 months of the year this system would not be
appropriate.   The solution in this case would be either to use a V.R.V heat recovery
system or have an independent system dedicated to that part of the building.</p><p>With the larger zoned systems typically it would be possible to connect up to 16 indoor
units to one external unit.   With most manufacturers the units may be mixed i.e. an
assortment of ducted, cassette, wall, floor, and ceiling units connected to the one
outdoor unit.</p></dd><dt><span class="small-caps">VRV</span> systems</dt><dd><p>These systems are the most versatile of the multi-split systems as the indoor units may
function individually and will heat or cool individually.   These systems are widely used
in commercial offices.</p></dd></dl><aside class="card"><h5 class="card-header">This article is provided by Ambthair&nbsp;Services</h5><div class="card-body"><p class="card-text">We provide air conditioning design and consultancy, specialising in studios and low energy systems.</p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="contact.html">Contact us</a></div></aside></main></article></div><footer class="py-4 bg-primary mt-auto"><div class="container"><p class="text-center text-white">Copyright © 2024 Ambthair Services Ltd.</p></div></footer><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-DfXdz2htPH0lsSSs5nCTpuj/zy4C+OGpamoFVy38MVBnE+IbbVYUew+OrCXaRkfj" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-OgVRvuATP1z7JjHLkuOU7Xw704+h835Lr+6QL9UvYjZE3Ipu6Tp75j7Bh/kR0JKI" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon="{&quot;token&quot;: &quot;43135c8b3dfb4e65bd227193a8be7f50&quot;}"></script></body></html>
