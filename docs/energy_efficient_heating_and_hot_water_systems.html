services, ventilation and air conditioning) all my working life and
have been looking at reducing the energy costs and carbon footprint of
my own 1950s home with the help of modern technology which I use
regularly for my own Clients.</p><p>We own a poorly insulated building in the South East of England
(that tailors&rsquo; wear the worst suit, springs to mind) with a
conventional oil-fired boiler.</p><p>The more I looked at solutions the more confused I became&nbsp;&ndash; and
I
thought if I am finding this such a challenge to consider replacement
options and greener solutions how must it be for other building owner/s
without any background in my industry.</p><p>The choices are made all the more difficult, because the decision to
renew/improve equipment for both house owners and building owners have
to second guess governments future actions, in particular, in relation
to grants and also second guess what is going to happen to fuel prices
in the near future and the long term future.</p><p>There is no lack of rhetoric about the phasing out of fossil fuels
and investment in renewable technologies and plenty of advice out there
regarding replacement equipment.</p><p>Some objective advice exists&nbsp;- but I could find little
practical
guidance
on the direct comparison and detailed/personalised payback costs (both
carbon and financial) of various technologies and the application to
heating and for onsite electrical generation for that matter&nbsp;&ndash; the
latter of which is likely to be encouraged by governments all over the
world in the future as this could play a decisive part in the reduction
of centralised and extremely inefficient generation and distribution
costs of electricity. (In the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> electrical distribution costs were
estimated to have an efficiency of 38.5% average in 2004).</p><p>So the following is what I know to be an independent report made in
the summer of 2009 on the possibilities of reducing energy and running
costs and carbon emissions both for domestic and commercial buildings
but with one eye also on possible/likely future trends.</p><p>You may or may not agree with my conclusions, but sincerely hope the
information is of interest and helps you to make decisions and ideas
for choices for your own property or buildings.</p><p>As with previous articles apologies in advance for those with
knowledge of building services for any over simplifications or stating
the obvious &ndash; but the article is intended for those with little or no
knowledge at all of the systems that are out there now &ndash; and it is
likely that most will agree the more people that have knowledge of the
choices the better.</p><p>Apologies also for this article mostly referring to costs or
circumstances in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> but hope that those with a broader vision than
my own may be able to adapt them to their own circumstances wherever
they are in the world geographically &ndash; many countries throughout the
world are faced with the same decisions and at the risk of repetition
the shift away from fossil fuel economies, of course, is a constantly
recurring theme.</p><p>Mike Hardy,<br>Horsham,<br>South East England</p><p>Ian McEwan, the prize winning
internationally acclaimed writer,
recently wrote in an article:</p><blockquote><p><span class="pull-double">&ldquo;</span>An alien landing on our planet and
noticing how it was bathed in
light would be amazed to learn that we believe ourselves to have an
energy problem, that we ever should have thought of overheating or
poisoning ourselves by burning fossil fuels or generating plutonium.
Sunlight falls on average by Nasa&rsquo;s calculation, 200 watts for every
square metre of the Earth&rsquo;s surface.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Ian McEwan may also have added that free
cooling for buildings by
the use of cold outside air being transferred to an overheating
building is also available throughout the world, and this same alien
would be equally amazed that very few air conditioning systems in the
world take advantage of this and instead almost always also use energy
in the form of fossil fuels to cool the air in a building and pay the
financial cost associated with this. (See article by the writer <a id="fc" href="free_cooling_and_low_energy_systems.html"><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>A
Practical Guide to Free Cooling, Alternative Cooling and Low Energy
Systems&rsquo;</a>).</p><h2 id="mozTocId17854">Introduction</h2><p>The rising costs and finite resources of fossil fuels, of course,
concentrate each and all of our minds on the subject now as never
before both in commercial and domestic buildings&nbsp;- this coupled
with
the
urgent need to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>With astonishing prescience Sweden had already announced in 2005
their intention to phase out dependence on fossil fuels by 2020&nbsp;-
this
is the same year predicted in December 2008 by Fatih Biro the Chief
Economist of the International Energy Authority for the global
&lsquo;plateau&rsquo; for conventional oil.</p><p>The huge significance of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>failing to initiate timely mitigation&rsquo;
before the plateau is spelled out clearly by the Hirsch committee
commissioned by the <span class="small-caps">US</span> department of energy and may be read at <a href="http://www.acus.org/docs/051007-Hirsch_World_Oil_Production.pdf">www.acus.org/docs/051007-Hirsch_World_Oil_Production.pdf</a> which will affect all aspects of our lives.</p><p>The Building Regulations in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>, for whatever reason have
permitted poorly insulated buildings to be built in the past (the
Regulations have significantly improved now) and most of the existing
building stock uses far more energy to heat than is necessary &ndash; this is
in stark contrast to some other countries particularly in Europe.</p><p>It is perfectly possible to build houses and commercial buildings
with a zero or almost zero requirement for heating and such houses
exist in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and Europe.</p><p>But new construction is not the consideration here and is for
another time, but the issue is how to improve the performance of
existing buildings so that energy consumption may be reduced and also
consider on site electrical generation which is likely to be encouraged
by most governments in the future.</p><h2 id="mozTocId27465">Insulation to Existing
Buildings</h2><p>This is by far and away the least expensive way to achieve a
reduction in energy costs and reduce carbon emissions, the Passivhaus&rsquo;s
in Germany, the Zedbed buildings in London, <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and the Building
Research Establishment buildings at Innovation Park, Watford, UK
amongst a number of buildings to show how effective well insulated
building can be.</p><p>The key areas to insulate in existing houses are lofts, walls, and
hot water storage cylinders and in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> the Energy Savings Trust
document<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Practical refurbishment of solid-walled houses&rsquo; is a useful
and detailed guide for insulating existing houses available from <a href="http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/business/Global-Data/Publications/Practical-refurbishment-of-solid-walled-houses-CE184">www.energysavingstrust.co.uk</a>.</p><p>Some of the information is equally applicable to commercial
buildings.</p><p>In the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> as well as other European countries some limited grants
are available; in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> the Carbon Trust will provide interest free
loans for commercial buildings many of us <em>very strongly</em>believe
these should be grants not loans available for buildings, particularly
in this harsh economic climate and would at the same time rejuvenate
some sectors of the construction industry. Thus the proposed packages
to reduce unemployment would also at the same time help to reduce the
use of fossil fuels and the emissions of carbon&nbsp;&ndash; something very
positive from what at the moment is a desperate financial situation for
many.</p><h3 id="mozTocId740544">Insulation &ndash; Hot
Water Storage</h3><h4 id="mozTocId24384">Using 88 mm Thick
Insulation on an Existing Cylinder</h4><p>The simplest addition of insulation is to the hot water cylinder
(calorifier or hot water storage tank) if this is not well insulated.</p><p>In the domestic market there is no disagreement about quick payback
costs here with a domestic jacket costing around &pound;12 (<span class="small-caps">DIY</span>) the Energy
Saving Trust say this will be a saving of about &pound;40 per year and
therefore a payback period of between of 5 months &ndash; except I make that
nearer 3 months.</p><p>They also state the carbon dioxide saving is around 195 kg. So based
on this figure they are estimating 1,054 kWh per annum will be saved
and
natural gas at 4p per kWh this approximates to a &pound;40 saving per annum.</p><p>So at 10p per kWh for electricity day rate that would be an
approximate &pound;100 per annum saving.</p><p>Although this will vary considerably with usage there is no doubt
that this is the best return for insulation and is a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>must do&rsquo; in all
houses with inadequate cylinder insulation and commercial buildings
where storage equipment is used with poor insulation.</p><h3 id="mozTocId632754">Insulation of
Existing Buildings</h3><p>The simplest and most effective way to insulate an existing building
is to provide insulation in the roof space and fill the wall cavities
with insulation.</p><p>The first port of call for carrying out this would have to be your
energy supplier (gas or electric) as the work would be subsidised by
them.</p><p>The Energy Savings Trust predicts a payback period from 2 to 6 years
for roof insulation and around 2 years for cavity wall insulation for a
gas fired installation.</p><p>Ambthair has published a <a id="pmb" href="calculate_financial_and_carbon_payback_from_insulating_multiple_buildings.html">guide for carrying out your own calculations for your own buildings for
both financial and carbon payback</a>. Alternatively, there is an extremely useful site at <a href="http://www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php">www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php</a>,
and use the property heating evaluation tool.</p><h3 id="mozTocId118296">Heat Recovery
Ventilation</h3><p>Once the above work is carried out the building will be well sealed
and more comfortable for all that. But the building does need
ventilation and this is resolved in well sealed buildings by the use
of a heat recovery unit. These ventilation units may recover as much at
70% to 80% of the heated air exhausted to atmosphere.</p><p>There are many of the above products available and Vent&ndash;Axia and
Xpelair amongst others explain their products on their web sites and
will also provide a design and application service based on their own
products.</p><p>The wind powered passive heat recovery units used at the Zedbed
project are available through the ZedFactory at <a href="http://www.zedfactory.com/">www.zedfactory.com</a>.</p><h2 id="mozTocId813223">Heat Generating
Equipment Common to Domestic and
Commercial/Industrial Buildings</h2><p>The least costly capital cost per kW of heat generating equipment is
still using fossil fuels; the conversion of the fuel to useful heat is
now much more efficient than has been the case in the past.</p><h3 id="mozTocId865090">Condensing Boilers</h3><p>Fuels: Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (<span class="small-caps">LPG</span>) or Oil. </p><p>Condensing boilers are available as both conventional or combination
(tankless) boilers. The condensing boilers are the most efficient
boilers as they are designed to recover heat normally discharged to
atmosphere through flues and are now mainly replacing most types of
boilers.</p><p>The boilers use a heat exchanger to reduce the temperature of the
exhaust gases which contribute to the heat recovery but the majority of
the energy is recovered from the condensation of the water vapour in
the exhaust gases this releases the latent heat of vaporization of the
water.</p><p>The actual efficiency of the boilers depends on the prevailing
humidity and temperature of the ambient air and will operate at its
most efficient if the incoming air is 100% relative humidity.</p><p>The Seasonal Efficiency of Domestic Boilers in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> (SEDBUK)
provides the following efficiency bands:</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-sm"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Band</th><th scope="col">Sedbuk Range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A</td><td>90% and above</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>86 &ndash; 90%</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>82 &ndash; 86%</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>78 &ndash; 82%</td></tr><tr><td>E</td><td>74 &ndash; 78%</td></tr><tr><td>F</td><td>70 &ndash; 74%</td></tr><tr><td>G</td><td>Below 70%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The boiler should be selected to be in B and A as indeed most
condensing boilers are.</p><h3 id="mozTocId623775">Matching of
Condensing Boilers to Existing Heating Systems</h3><p>The correct matching of condensing boilers to existing
&lsquo;traditionally designed&rsquo; systems is not always straightforward and
needs to be considered carefully in order that boilers operate at the
optimum efficiency in condensing mode and therefore maximum financial
and carbon payback benefits.</p><p>Most existing systems, including all radiators or heat emitters will
have been sized on the traditional boiler temperatures of an 82&deg;C
flow water temperature from the boiler and 71&deg;C return water
temperature to the boiler, but a condensing boiler operating with the
same return of 71&deg;C will fail to condense and therefore these
temperatures are not suitable for a condensing boiler as they will be
inefficient.</p><p>For condensing mode the lower the return water temperature the
better, a typical flow and return water temperature for a condensing
boiler is 70&deg;C and 50&deg;C respectively
and if the return temperature is further reduced to say 40&deg;C the boiler
will be even more efficient.</p><p>The return water temperature is the important factor in enabling the
boiler to condense and generally speaking should always be around 50&deg;C
or
lower.</p><p>There is an advantage to keeping the flow temperature high to say
80&deg;C and a system selected to operate at 80&deg;C flow and 50&deg;C.</p><p>The advantage of this is that the mean temperature is raised from
60&deg;C (70 flow and 50 return) to 65&deg;C (80 flow and 50 return).</p><p>If, as is likely, a traditional 82 flow and 71 return (mean 75.5&deg;C)
temperatures
were used to size the heat emitters or radiators then the mean
temperature provided by the new condensing boiler needs to be as high
as
possible.</p><p>Even then if the original radiators were sized very accurately for
the lowest winter temperatures the system may struggle to hold the
desired room temperatures, although systems tended to be oversized in
the past.</p><p>The other reason for keeping the flow temperature high is if there
is an indirect cylinder or calorifier, water will need to be stored at
60&deg;C or more (to prevent colonising by micro organisms) and again
as high a mean temperature as possible would be needed.</p><p>For the above reasons it would be worth considering an independent
engineer to look at a particular application, it may be necessary to
reduce the heating water flow rate and possible change the heating pump
to obtain the optimum temperatures described above.</p><p>The above comments would apply to the application of any condensing
boiler to an existing system.</p><p>Over the last 5 years there have been question marks over the
reliability of some condensing boilers. The application of the boiler
and the selection of a reliable model of boiler are therefore absolutely
critical.</p><p>For the domestic market, Which have provided an <a href="http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/boilers/page/condensing-boilers-explained/">independent guide</a>.</p><p>You will see that the worst case is that for a selected group of 34
people who purchased from a particular manufacturer 79% of them had
problems since 2005&nbsp;&ndash; so this is why it is so important to choose
carefully.</p><h4 id="mozTocId277643">Domestic</h4><h5 id="mozTocId280388">Combi &ndash; Condensing
Boilers (Tankless or Instant Heaters)</h5><p>Fuels &ndash; Gas, <span class="small-caps">LPG</span> or Oil. </p><p>Very efficient combi boilers are now used all over Europe for
domestic applications and as the name implies all equipment is combined
in the one boiler. Combi boilers are able to provide both heating and
instantaneous hot water at the same time and so there are generally no
energy losses using hot water storage equipment in the form of an
indirect hot water cylinder.</p><p>In the past combi boilers were usually limited to an output of 24kW
and 28kW but now a much larger range is available up to 54kW which will
be suitable for most houses except the very largest. (The output
figures refer to the hot water output&nbsp;&ndash; the heating output
available
for radiators etc. is generally 5 to 10kW less than this figure).</p><p>When replacing a conventional boiler it is important to check the condensing boiler manufacturers requirements for both the pressure of the mains water and also the size of the incoming gas main.  These may need to be increased and is an important cost consideration for the application for a condensing boiler as both increasing water pressure and gas main size can be expensive.</p><p>The latest generation of combi boilers have an intelligent pre heat
mode and this monitors the hot water usage over the previous 24 hours
and preheats for a short while before the first anticipated use.</p><p>The Energy Savings Trust gives a figure of saving up to &pound;235 per
year by replacing an old boiler with an efficient condensing boiler and
a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of up to 1,300 kilograms per
year.</p><p>Based on this if the new installation is around &pound;2,300 then the
financial payback is about 10 years.</p><p>The<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Greener Homes Price Guide&rsquo; published by the Royal Institute of
Chartered Surveyors gives a financial payback figure of 18 years.</p><p>See Ambthair&apos;s guide on <a id="psb" href="calculate_financial_and_carbon_payback_from_insulating_single_building.html">a method of calculating the financial and carbon payback for an
individual building</a>.</p><h4 id="mozTocId779003">Condensing Boilers
for Commercial Installations</h4><p>Fuels &ndash; Gas, <span class="small-caps">LPG</span> or Oil. </p><p>As stated above Combi condensing boilers are able to provide both
heating and instantaneous water but they are limited to a capacity of
about 54kW.</p><p>For a commercial application if an existing boiler is to be
replaced then this could be replaced with a new condensing boiler and
at the same time it may be worth considering replacement of the
calorifier or heat storage for hot water with a new plate heat
exchanger.</p><p>This would then have the advantage of providing hot water
instantaneously when it is required rather than storing hot water. The
sizing of the new boiler has to be considered carefully and may need to
be sized for a higher heat output than the boiler being replaced. This
would be because if there is a high heating demand in winter in cold
weather and at the same time a high hot water service demand the new
boiler with an identical heat output may not cope. Rather than increase
the boiler output it is not uncommon, using controls, to arrange
a priority system and
in
this way keep the boiler the same size as the old boiler.</p><p>This priority system is easier to arrange for a domestic system than
a commercial system.</p><p>The plate heat exchanger manufacturer will normally size the plate
heat exchanger size based on hot water outlets.</p><p>See Ambthair&apos;s guide on <a id="psb2" href="calculate_financial_and_carbon_payback_from_insulating_single_building.html">a method of calculating the financial and carbon payback for an
individual building</a>.</p><h4 id="mozTocId316994">Heat Pumps&nbsp;&ndash;
for Heating Only&nbsp;&ndash; Domestic and Commercial</h4><p>Fuel: Electricity, but used much more efficiently than
conventional electrical resistance heating.</p><p>Heat pumps are said by many to be coming of age for heating only
applications.</p><p>I have specified and selected heat pumps for many years but not for
heating only but for cooling and heating of commercial buildings&nbsp;&ndash;
those who have been in a similar position will well remember the
unreliability of heat pumps approximately 20 years or more ago (not
untypical for an emerging technology) but that has all changed in the
last 10 years.</p><p>Heat pumps are used widely in Sweden and Canada and both countries
have far colder winters than the UK&nbsp;&ndash; so the question is why are
they
so rarely used for heating only in the UK?&nbsp;- and why are air
source
heat pumps not even considered by the framework suppliers because of
what the Building Research Establishment call<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>lack of interest&rsquo; thus
at a stroke ignoring an entire industry&nbsp;- see under <a href="#mozTocId821231"><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Grants for Public Buildings&rsquo;</a> for
this
discussion.</p><p>The refrigeration cycle is probably at its clearest to understand
when used in a refrigerator where the evaporator inside the
refrigerator cools the air and is connected by refrigeration pipework
and a compressor to the condenser which is at the back and rejects heat
and why it is warm.</p><p>A heat pump in addition to the above reverses this cycle, the
external
coil extracting heat from the air (no matter how cold) to provide heat
to the coil inside the refrigerator.</p><p>The miracle of the heat pump is the efficiency or more correctly the
Coefficient of Performance (referred as CoP throughout) in using
electrical energy.</p><p>For each 1kW of input of electrical energy&nbsp;- 1.5kW to 6kW may
be
provided as useful heat depending on a number of factors.</p><p>As the CoP of heat pumps increases due to development progress, so
does their viability for consideration of being a source of replacement
heating.</p><p>Heat pumps are made in the form of air source, ground source and
water source and as the names imply the energy for heating is being
extracted from in the case of<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>air source&rsquo; the external air, in the
case of ground source it is underneath the soil and in the case of
&lsquo;water source&rsquo; from water for example in a lake or stream.</p><p>As the discussion is about replacing equipment for more efficient
equipment of the different heat pumps, the air source heat pump would
be
the most simple and economic to install.</p><p>An external heat pump such as may be seen canti&ndash;levered at the back
of a typical retail unit, would be all that was required for small
installations.</p><p>It is true the CoP of air source heat pumps becomes poorer as the
weather gets colder whereas ground source heat pumps stays roughly
constant all the time.</p><p>However, a ground source heat pump requires excavation of land, and
quite
apart from the land required there is a higher cost of installation.</p><p>Innovation and competition between manufacturers has meant that both
the CoP and the water flow temperature for air source heat pumps are
improving all the time.</p><p>Traditionally the water flow temperature for an air source heat pump
used to be (and still is with many) around 40 to 45&deg;C so auxiliary
(top up) electrical heating was required to raise the temperature
further so that they could be used to replace conventional boilers.</p><p>However, recently one manufacturer has stated their heat pump using
carbon dioxide as a refrigerant could achieve a flow temperature of
65&deg;C (top up electrical heating is used to raise the temperature
still further if required) and another manufacturer using 2 stages of
heating provides a maximum flow temperature of 80&deg;C this time
without any top up electrical heating.</p><p>So now heat pumps are competing for the first time with boilers
without the necessity of auxiliary or top up electric heating in the
form of an electric immersion.</p><p>Paul Braithwaite of the Heat Pump Association has suggested in
Sweden (domestic heat pumps are more widely used in mainland Europe
than the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>) that the heat pump provide about 70% of the heating with
the electrical immersion doing the remaining 30%.</p><p>For both domestic and commercial applications the capital cost of
heat pumps per kW of heating is considerably more than
conventional boiler output per kW&nbsp;- but this needs to be looked at
further in terms of financial and carbon payback costs.</p><p>In the case of commercial heat pumps if both the heating and cooling
cycle is used in practice, then this would of course reduce the
comparative capital costs because a boiler and a chiller would be
required as against a single heat pump.</p><p>The Energy Savings Trust estimate the cost of an air to water heat
pump is between &pound;5,000 and &pound;10,000 for a detached house (excluding
VAT)&nbsp;&ndash; this would be instead of a boiler.</p><p>They estimate that annual running cost savings vary, depending on
the fuel being displaced, from &pound;300 (gas), &pound;870 (electricity) and &pound;580
(oil).</p><p>The variation in cost for equipment varies hugely both domestically
and commercially, if it is acceptable for the replacement to have a low
flow temperature (such as for underfloor heating) then the cost of the
heat pump will reduce considerably.</p><p>However, I want to consider the heat pumps with a high flow
temperature because these are the natural replacements for most
existing boilers and these heat pumps are certainly not the least
expensive.</p><p>I estimate a high temperature heat pump with a heating capacity of
15kW could be installed for around &pound;10,000. (Cost of equipment &pound;5,000 or
&pound;6,000).</p><p>If we assume the following rates:</p><table class="table table-sm"><tbody><tr><td>Electricity</td><td>10p/kWh</td></tr><tr><td>Gas</td><td>4p/kWh</td></tr><tr><td>Oil</td><td>6p/kWh</td></tr></tbody></table><p>We have also to assume an average CoP value for the heating
season&nbsp;&ndash;
so we assume 3.5.</p><p>At a CoP of 3.5 the electricity price becomes effectively 2.85p/kWh,
which would be even less if off-peak heating is used for early morning
heat up&nbsp;&ndash;
but
we will keep with the 2.85 figure.</p><p>For say a &pound;2,000 oil fuel bill per annum then this would be reduced
to &pound;949 using the heat pump and the above assumptions.</p><p>A financial payback of round about 10 years. </p><p>For say a &pound;2,000 gas bill per annum this would reduce to &pound;1,425 and a
financial payback time of about 18 years.</p><p>The carbon savings would be based on the above. </p><p>There is no doubt that the Coefficient of Performance and (just as
importantly for replacement of equipment in buildings) the flow
temperature is improving all the time.</p><p>A recent book written by Professor David <span class="small-caps">JC</span> Mackay titled
&lsquo;Sustainable Energy&nbsp;&ndash; Without the Hot Air&rsquo; and available for downloading at <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">www.withouthotair.com</a>,
publishes the informative comparison for boilers, heat pumps and
combined heat and power shown below.</p><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" id="energy_comparison_chart" src="assets/efficiency_of_electrical_energy_vs_heat_energy.png" width="468" height="578" alt="Line graph with electrical efficiency on the x axis plotted against heat efficiency on the y axis, of a selection of energy sources"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Graph comparing efficiency of electrical energy vs heat energy for several energy sources</figcaption></figure><p>The diagram plots CoPs of 3 and 4 for heat pumps and as he
says in his book<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Let me spell this out. Heat pumps are superior in
efficiency to condensing boilers, even if heat pumps are powered by
electricity from a power station burning natural gas&rsquo;.</p><p>He goes on to say<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>The heat-pump solution has further
advantages that should be emphasized: heat pumps can be located in any
buildings where there is an electricity supply; they can be driven by
any electricity source, so they keep on working when the gas runs out
or the gas price goes through the roof; and heat pumps are flexible:
they can be turned on and off to suit the demand of the building
occupants.</p><p>The diagram for CoPs of only of 3 and 4 and there is little
doubt that these CoPs will improve and the cost of heat pumps will
come down. (Some heat pumps in Japan are said to be achieving CoPs of
6 but I do not have the information at what external temperature and
what flow temperature.)</p><p>The diagram is an interesting and informative way of
considering the economics of heat pumps, condensing boilers and
combined heat and power.</p><p>Remember these are for air source heat pumps&nbsp;&ndash; by far the
easier of the heat pumps to retrofit into a building&nbsp;&ndash; and are the
same
heat pumps that the framework suppliers who are involved in huge
public contracts have expressed no interest in. Perhaps Professor David
JC MacKay would kindly<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>spell this out&rsquo; to the framework
suppliers please.</p><p>One final kick for air source heat pumps&nbsp;- the Energy Savings
Trust tell me there is up to a &pound;900 grant available from the Low Carbon
Buildings Grant allocation as long as the heat pump heats only and does
not cool.</p><p>Of course this is nonsense, because most heat pumps cool as
well heat, so probably the majority of manufacturers cannot encourage
customers to claim the grant&nbsp;&ndash; leaders in the field such as Daikin
confirm this to me and so also, no doubt, would Mitsubishi, Sanyo and
other leading manufacturers if I asked them.</p><h3 id="mozTocId201601">Combined Heat and
Power (Cogeneration)&nbsp;&ndash; Domestic and Commercial Heat and
Electricity Generation</h3><p>Talking of Combined Heat and Power of which we were under heat pumps
lets have a closer look at this replacement technology which will
generate both heat and electricity.</p><h4 id="mozTocId584254">Micro <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> for Domestic</h4><p>The <span class="small-caps">EU</span> cogeneration directive defines, perhaps a little confusingly,
micro generation as units that provide up to 50kW of onsite electricity.</p><p>Generally only the smallest micro generation unit is suitable for a
domestic application and that unit is described below.</p><h5 id="mozTocId434557">Engine Driven</h5><p>Fuel: gas&nbsp;- provides heating and on site electricity generation.</p><p>The very smallest micro combined heat and power as applied to
domestic properties is in its infancy&nbsp;&ndash; and many people find the
prospect
of
generating electricity and heat within their own home a useful and
exciting proposition.</p><p>There are a number of companies now competing and developing
equipment in this field.</p><p>It is estimated by some in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> that ultimately domestic micro CHP
may provide 20% or so of the electricity generating capacity&nbsp;&ndash;
which is
more than currently obtained from nuclear power.</p><p>In terms of leaders in the field is a gas burning generator called
the Whispergen which has been developed in New Zealand. This produces
both
heat and electricity and makes no more noise than a refrigerator it is
claimed. It is also similar in size to a floor standing refrigerator.</p><p>The unit is in effect a tiny power station and uses a stirling
engine and produces and requires approximately 6.6 kWth (kW of heat) to
provide 1 kWe (kW of electricity).</p><p>The unit will also provide additional heat, as required, by the use
of a heat exchanger of approximately 6kW.</p><p>In the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>, before E.ON Energy took over Powergen it was announced
that the Whispergen would go on sale it is thought for &pound;3,000.00
including installation&nbsp;&ndash; the unit will use natural gas&nbsp;&ndash;
there seems to
be some doubt the &pound;3,000 figure is still valid.</p><p>As boilers are replaced then these can be replaced by the Whispergen
which would provide electricity (the owner is able to sell surplus
electrical energy to the grid) and heat for both heating and hot water.</p><p>The unit is being manufactured in Spain by a recently formed
consortium called Efficient Home Energy and it is thought that they
will be available in the Netherlands and Germany in 2009 and in the UK
late 2009 or early 2010.</p><p>On the face of it the Whispergen micro generation unit will be an
answer to many things because as heating is required then at the same
time electricity is also generated for use in your home or selling back
to the grid.</p><p>If this is the case then gas fired homes facing replacement boilers
should consider switching to Whispergen units when they are available
or to one of their competitors such as Baxi who are mentioned below
and claim they will have similar equipment available which they say
they
are putting through extensive trials in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>.</p><p>The Whispergen combined heat and power unit produces electricity at
near to the maximum stirling engine heat output of 6.6kW.</p><p>Baxi have been established in the <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> field for some time and have
recently also developed a micro <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> unit also using a stirling engine
and state that it provides 1kW of electricity and 6kW of heat, they
say also that as heat demand falls off then 1kW of electricity will
still be provided down to 4kW of heat.</p><p>An additional 18kW of heat is provided by a heat exchanger,
providing a total output of 24kW available for heating.</p><p>My understanding from the information I have received is that the
Whispergen will always have to provide a minimum of 6kW of heat to
provide 1kW of electricity and the Baxi Ecogen unit a minimum of 4kW
to provide 1kW of electricity.</p><p>Baxi state they are running extensive trials in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and the unit
should be available in 2009 and will go on sale to private households
through British Gas.</p><p>A number of other companies are developing units by themselves or
involved in consortiums.</p><p>For electricity some organizations have proposed the use of solar
panels and industrial lead acid batteries for storage to cover the gaps
in summer and winter (See <a href="#mozTocId670678">solar energy</a>.)</p><p>The reason for this is because it would not be economic to run the
microgeneration units in summer because heat is always generated&nbsp;&ndash;
unless of course there is a reason for providing heat in summer.</p><h5 id="mozTocId106430">Financial and Carbon
Payback</h5><p>The <a href="http://www.carbontrust.co.uk">Carbon Trust</a> have been running
what is believed to be the UK&rsquo;s
first major field trials since Spring 2005 and through to 2008 of 87
micro-combined heat and power systems for both domestic and small
commercial units and
included in the trial are 27 condensing boilers&nbsp;- the Whispergen
Mark 5
was one of the units under trial.</p><p>The conclusions so far (a further report is expected) have
demonstrated carbon and cost savings from micro&ndash;combined heat and power
where they can
operate for long and consistent heating periods.</p><p>Their conclusion is that for older larger houses with a high and
consistent heat demand the carbon saving is from 5 to 10%.</p><p>The domestic system has been found to save &pound;40 to &pound;90 relative to a
condensing boiler depending on export reward to the electricity grid.</p><p>The Carbon Trust suggests a 20 year payback that will come down to
7&nbsp;&ndash; 15 years.</p><p>The trial demonstrated that the unit generated peak power
corresponding with peaks in domestic demand and therefore appears to be
beneficial for the electricity network.</p><h4 id="mozTocId219544">Combined Heat and
Power (<span class="small-caps">CHP</span>) and District Heating&nbsp;- Commercial</h4><p>Fuels: They may be manufactured to burn almost anything including
the conventional fuels.</p><p>Combined heat and power (<span class="small-caps">CHP</span>) is the use of a heat engine as
described above to simultaneously generate both electricity and useful
heat in commercial and industrial buildings and quite unlike micro CHP
for houses has a long history within the building service industry. (I
will use the nomenclature <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> throughout.)</p><p><span class="small-caps">CHP</span> generates useful energy, at the point of use, in the form of
both electricity and heat, with an overall efficiency typically up to
80%.</p><p>District heating again uses <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> but a centralised plant is used to
serve domestic or commercial properties. <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> is widely used in parts of
Eastern Europe; for example, Helsinki is mostly served by a district
heating
system.</p><p>So when should a Building Owner of an existing building consider
CHP? Are there any initial considerations that may be made to
indicate that <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> would be of financial benefit, and who should the
Building Owner consult for a detailed analysis of the on site
situation?</p><p>Financial investment in <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> may be considerable and the worst case
scenario is that a major investment may be made with a poor or
negative financial return.</p><p>It has been suggested in the past that for economic viability a site
must normally have an electricity load of at least 45kW and a heat load
of 120kW. Simultaneous demand for heat and power must also be present
for at least 4500 hours a year (about 50% annual load factor).</p><p>A beneficial time to consider <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> is likely to be when much of the
old boiler plant needs replacing and capital investment in new heating
plant is required anyway.</p><p>If both the above criteria are met it would certainly be worth
consulting a <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> specialist who would assess the economics of a range
of <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> sizes and ideally these should be sized using daily demand
profiles in order to accurately determine the actual amount of heat and
power that may be supplied to the building.</p><p>Where necessary, thermal storage may be used to smooth the demand
profiles and maximize the economics of the <span class="small-caps">CHP</span>.</p><p>Accurate sizing is vital to the good application of <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> and it is
important, just like micro <span class="small-caps">CHP</span>, that equipment should not be oversized.</p><p>Small systems from 15kWe up to 1MWe are most commonly used for
commercial buildings, and these usually use internal combustion engines
burning
gas or oil. They are normally developed as a complete package
and are
relatively easy to install, usually small enough to be located
in existing boiler rooms. They effectively replace the main boiler
which would be linked to the existing heating distribution system.</p><p>There are a number of ways of financing <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> installations which are:</p><ol><li>Purchase of the system outright in which case the Building Owner
undertakes all capital costs and realises all subsequent savings.
Alternatively,</li><li><p>The <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> supplier offers an arrangement whereby the supply and
maintenance of the equipment is at their cost, typically the Building
Owner pays for the gas or oil consumed by the <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> equipment and
purchases the generated electricity from the supplier at a reduced
price as well as well as receiving the heat at zero cost.</p><p>This arrangement is suitable for a Building Owner not wishing to
make a major financial investment and also transfers some risk to the
equipment supplier.</p></li></ol><p>Clearly a <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> specialist is required to evaluate and size the
proposed <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> system and assess financial payback.</p><p><span class="small-caps">CHP</span> suppliers offer this services as well as electricity suppliers
and likely to offer advice and selection free of charge.</p><p>The following website will provide guidance and information on
where to obtain completely independent advice and surveys:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.cibse.org/chp">The <span class="small-caps">CIBSE</span> CHP

absorption chilling to provide cooling in summer or processes requiring
chiller water or air.</p><p>The process of <span class="small-caps">CHP</span> produces heat and power, however during the
summer months the heat generated in many cases is likely not to be
fully
utilised on site. It is during this time that the demand for cooling
often reaches its maximum. If cooling is required then the solution is
to use the excess heat to operate an absorption chiller which is linked
to the cogeneration unit providing air conditioning. It is an irony
that heat is required in order to cool, which is not the case for
conventional air conditioning equipment, but is with the absorption
process and has been used for many years. The origins of absorption
chillers go back to work carried out by Albert Einstein in the <span class="small-caps">USA</span> on
domestic refrigerators.</p><p>(He had yet another role to play in the <span class="small-caps">HVAC</span> industry and one for
which he received his Nobel Prize&nbsp;&ndash; see later under <a href="#mozTocId425457">photovoltaics</a>).</p><figure class="figure"><img class="img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/typical_absorption_process.jpeg" width="424" height="300" alt="Diagram of absorption process"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Typical absorption process</figcaption></figure><h4 id="mozTocId774152">Typical Absorption

therefore suitable for absorption units shown above.</p><h3 id="mozTocId670678">Solar Thermal
Collectors &ndash; Domestic and Commercial</h3><p>Solar heating makes use of flat plate or evacuated collectors which
absorb sunlight to provide heating.</p><p>So this method of heating is free after installation costs except
for the running of an electrical pump.</p><p>But what of the economics of solar heating in a country which is not
blessed with an awful lot of sun, such as the UK?</p><p>I have heard all sorts of anecdotal stories in the UK&nbsp;&ndash; i.e.
&ldquo;it
would be <span class="small-caps">OK</span> if we had more sun&rdquo; to the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">&ldquo;</span>I have lashings of hot water
all summer&rdquo;.</p><p>So which is correct? </p><p>A report was published in 2001 describing work carried out as part
of the Department of Trade and Industry Sustainable Energy Programme.</p><p>The report describes results of comparing eight solar water heating
systems mounted side by side so direct comparison could be made.</p><p>Six flat plate and two evacuated tube panels were installed and the
efficiency of converting the solar energy to provide heat for 150
litres of water was compared over an approximately 6 month period
between December and June.</p><p>The evacuated tube panels were shown to have an efficiency of 56% to
54% per square metre of absorber area and from this was deducted what
the report described as<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>parasitical energy&rsquo; to drive an electrical
pump.</p><p>In approximate terms this would then reduce the efficiency to about
50% and an estimated carbon dioxide reduction of between 109 and 104 kg
per square metre.</p><p>The Renewable Energy Association (<span class="small-caps">REA</span>) give a figure of solar
radiation from a south facing collector inclined at 30 degrees in South
West England as 1250 kWh per square metre per annum and records from
Kew over 20 years in the same circumstances show an average of 1067 kWh
per square metre per annum. (The <span class="small-caps">REA</span> give a comparative figure of 900
kWh per square metre per annum for North Scotland).</p><p>So to be conservative we could reasonably expect
0.5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1067 kWh per
metre squared&nbsp;= 533 kWh per metre squared of useful heat for water
from
an absorber using an evacuated tube collector.</p><p>This is a significant amount of energy and surprised me, maybe I had
been listening to the detractors of solar energy in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> for too
long&nbsp;&ndash; but we still have to look at financial payback and carbon
payback.</p><p>Whilst researching the subject of solar panels I came across on the
internet articles entitled<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Active solar technology&rsquo; and<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Urban solar
water heating&rsquo; both written by the Department of Mechanical Engineering
at the <a href="http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk">University of Strathclyde</a> (they
say nominated centre of
excellence in energy utilisation by the Building Research
Establishment).</p><p>What comes over to me from these articles is that they are evidently
as enthusiastic about this technology as I am.</p><p>One report states that<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>many potential customers were put off
solar
water heaters due to a bad perception of the technology from the
installation of unreliable systems in the 1970s&rsquo;.</p><p>I remember that well, there were problems with systems and generally
this technology had an awful press&nbsp;&ndash; not unlike the early days of
the
heat pump industry at around the same time.</p><p>The article also quotes<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>the accessible resource for solar
domestic
hot water systems by 2025 is estimated to be 12 terawatt hours [1
terawatt hour =
1,000,000,000 kWh] based on 50% of the housing stock being suitable for
water panels system and that each system provides 1200 kWh per year&rsquo;.</p><p>They quote their source as<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>New and renewable energy; Prospects in
the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> for the 21st Century&rsquo;.</p><p>Professor David <span class="small-caps">JC</span> Mackay says in his book, Sustainable Energy&nbsp;-
Without the Hot Air,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Solar thermal water heaters are a no brainer.
They will work almost everywhere in the world.&rsquo;</p><p>But let&rsquo;s curb this enthusiasm for the moment, the independent
trials in Cranfield in 2001 and the carbon payback calculation are
encouraging, there just remains the small matter of financial payback.</p><p>An instant slap in the face is provided by the <span class="small-caps">RICS</span> publication<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>The
Greener House Price Guide&rsquo; where the errata slip pessimistically states
under the heading<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Installation of solar panels including all plumbing
alterations and
making good”, that financial payback is greater than 100 years
(previously
given as 208 years in the same book and revised by way of the errata
slip).</p><p>The Energy Saving Trust are not much more optimistic, they state the
installation cost is between &pound;3,000 and &pound;5,000 with heating bill
reduction a measly &pound;50 to &pound;95 per year with 645 kg of carbon dioxide
emissions saved. (Saving based on a three bed semi.)</p><p>So that is a financial payback of between 31 years (best case) and
91 years (worst case) and reflects the approximate nature of these
calculations and serves to show how important it is for each building
owner to factor in their own specific situation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s look closely at the figures: </p><p>Grants for public buildings are 50%.</p><p>Domestic grants for England and Wales are &pound;400. For Scotland the
grant is for
30% of the cost of the installation up to &pound;4,000, and for Northern
Ireland the grant is &pound;1,125.</p><p>The University of Strathclyde again quotes New and Renewable Energy
for the following performance figures&nbsp;&ndash; and the annual kilowatt
hour
figures are not far away at all from the 2001 Cranfield trials:</p><blockquote><p>Typical system area 3 &ndash; 4 square metres.</p><p>Typical system price:</p><ul><li>Retrofit including <span class="small-caps">VAT</span>: &pound;2,000 to &pound;6,000</li><li><span class="small-caps">DIY</span> including <span class="small-caps">VAT</span> or new build: &pound;1,000 to &pound;2,500</li></ul><p>Such a system would require an installation of typically 1 to 2
days
and would have an estimated lifetime of 25 years. Annual pump running
costs are estimated at &pound;10 per year.</p><p>A typical system of 3 to 4 square metres would collect up to 1000
&ndash;
1500 kWh annually.</p></blockquote><p>I question how realistic the figure of &pound;1,000 is for DIY&nbsp;&ndash; I
have
been quoted &pound;1,899 including <span class="small-caps">VAT</span> for 3.6 square metres of panels
including the cylinder and everything except the pipework so the upper
DIY figure of &pound;2,500 seems more realistic&nbsp;&ndash; but if the economy of
scale
of solar took off may well squeeze the figures down to those quoted.</p><p>The University of Strathclyde goes on to say that in typical UK
conditions such a system will collect up to about 350 kWh per metre
square per annum.</p><p>So let us work on that figure&nbsp;&ndash; if we have an installation of 4
square metres that is an annual gain of 1,400 kWh&nbsp;&ndash; so how much is
that
worth financially, assuming it is all used usefully?</p><p>For gas 4.0p&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1,400&nbsp;=&nbsp;&pound;56. With &pound;400 grant in
England and Wales then
revised costs will be between &pound;600 and &pound;5,400 so payback between 10.7
years and 96 years.</p><p>In Scotland &pound;4,000 is paid up to a maximum of 30%. So the revised
costs after the grant would be between &pound;700 and &pound;4,200 so payback
between 14 years and 88 years.</p><p>With a &pound;1,125 grant for Northern Ireland then the revised costs will
be between &pound;0 and &pound;4,875 so payback between nought pounds and 99 years.</p><p>What is not factored into the above figures is the efficiency of the
means of production of the heat at the moment say by a boiler&nbsp;&ndash;
which
if it is say 70% efficient would be more of a saving than shown.</p><p>For electricity 10p&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;1,400&nbsp;=&nbsp;&pound;140. Electricity
is costing 2.5 times
as much as the gas so the payback time will be 2.5 times less than
those for gas.</p><p>Commercially each building will have to be looked at individually
much the same as Combined Heat and Power.</p><p>The evacuated panels themselves are not that expensive&nbsp;&ndash; for
example
36 square metres of panels providing 12,600 kilowatt hours per annum
would be around &pound;6 to &pound;7,000 which if the boilers was 78% efficient
would provide the equivalent of 18,000 kilowatt hours per annum.</p><p>At a typical cost of 4p per kilowatt hour this would save &pound;720
annually.</p><p>For say a financial payback of 20 years the installation needs to
not exceed a cost of &pound;12,250.00&nbsp;&ndash; and given the figures above it
is
unlikely to&nbsp;&ndash; especially if installed when the building is being
constructed.</p><p>If the price of gas doubles by 2012 as some predict then the pay
back periods would half again&nbsp;&ndash; if the building is a public
building
then the 50% grant is likely to reduce the paybacks anywhere between 6
years and 55 years and the doubling of the costs of gas would reduce
the figure further between 3 year and 27 years.</p><p>There is no doubt in my mind of the importance of solar thermal
heaters for now or in the future.</p><p>This is an almost free resource after a not very expensive
installation and quite why the technology has been routinely ignored
both domestically and commercially is a mystery.</p><p>The figures shown would come down further for new
installations.</p><p>A solar hot water design tool at <a href="http://www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php">www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php</a> will assess the potential and payback period using solar thermal
energy.</p><h3 id="mozTocId425457">Photovoltaics</h3><p>The photoelectric effect was first noted by a French physicist,
Edmund Becquerel, in 1839, who found that certain materials would
produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. In
1905, Albert Einstein described the nature of light and the
photoelectric effect on which photovoltaic technology is based, for
which he later won a Nobel Prize in physics.</p><p>To my mind the discovery is still breathtaking&nbsp;&ndash; producing
electricity from light is something that could only have been dreamed
of in the past&nbsp;&ndash; and light is everywhere&nbsp;&ndash; and the technology
is
improving in leaps and bounds. So objectively what is not to like about
PV?</p><p>The biggest hurdle as we shall see is financial payback with carbon
payback much less so.</p><p>I went to an informative and honest presentation recently by a
leading manufacturer of <span class="small-caps">PV</span> cells and inevitably the questions turned to
financial payback periods. The talker looked crestfallen or was it a
mild frustration at this wonderful technology and facility being
reduced to mere financial sums as he tried to put the case that with PV
long term financial planning is required with very real long term gains.</p><p><span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Do you look at the financial payback of a new car? Or when the
Victorians built the sewers and bridges were they analysing the
payback?&apos; He could have replied,<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&apos;</span>Or are there certain
decisions that
are so important, such as an uninterruptible and carbon free
electricity
grid for our children and their children that this question is no
longer valid?&apos;&nbsp;&ndash; but he didn&rsquo;t.</p><p><span class="small-caps">PV</span> solar panels generate electricity from sunlight and even work,
though less effectively, in overcast conditions. The <span class="small-caps">PV</span> cell includes
one or two layers of semi-conducting material, usually silicon.</p><p>To be effective, a <span class="small-caps">PV</span> system needs to be installed on a roof that
faces within 90 degrees of south and is not overshadowed by trees or
buildings. The electricity generated is in the form of Direct Current
(DC)&nbsp;- normally 12 volt and converted to Alternating Current (AC)
using
an inverter and is connected into the <span class="small-caps">AC</span> building supply.</p><p>There are three basic types <span class="small-caps">PV</span> panels: monocrystalline,
polycrystalline (or multicrystalline) and amorphous; all are made from
silicon.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Only daylight is needed to create energy.</li><li>Can be connected to the national grid and any excess
electricity sold back to an electricity company.</li><li>Solar energy is free, plentiful and clean.</li><li>Generally planning permission is not required when installed
correctly.</li><li>The electrical infra-structure already exists. </li><li>There are no carbon emissions once installed. </li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>A large roof area is needed to generate lots of energy. 1.5kWp
would normally be installed on an average size house which would cover
an area of 12 square metres.</li><li>The efficiency of solar panels depends on the number of solar
light hours and climate.</li><li>Initial costs are higher than conventional electric and
gas-heater
systems.</li><li>An unshaded, south-facing location is needed for installation</li></ul><p>Most solar energy manufacturers use the <a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/">Photovoltaic Geographical
Information System</a> for determining the solar irradiation in any
part of
the world.</p><p>This figure of course varies significantly throughout the world. </p><p>The industry is expanding hugely and most notably in Germany and
Japan.</p><h4 id="mozTocId976030">Financial Payback and
Carbon Payback</h4><p>There is little doubt in some people&apos;s mind that photovoltaics
together with offshore wind power will contribute to the possibility
of a carbon free electricity grid&nbsp;&ndash; particularly in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>.</p><p>The strength of a <span class="small-caps">PV</span> cell is measured in kilowatt peak (kWp)&nbsp;&ndash;
that
is the amount of energy the cell generates in full sunlight.</p><p>The <span class="small-caps">RICS</span> Green Home Guide gives an installation figure of &pound;8 to
&pound;9,000 for a 1.5 kWp <span class="small-caps">PV</span> system for a terraced house, &pound;10,000 to &pound;12,000
for a 2 kWp system for a semi-detached house and &pound;25,000 for a 5 kWp
for
a detached house.</p><p>The Energy Saving Trust state that is likely that a 2.5 kWp
photovoltaic cell will
provide 50% of annual electricity consumption for houses, and surplus
electricity may be sold back to the grid and the saving can be
considerable&nbsp;- up to 1.2 tonnes of <span class="small-caps">CO</span><sub>2</sub> a year, and
around &pound;250
reduction of the electricity bill.</p><p>There has been a debate going on about the payback period for PV
within the industry&nbsp;&ndash; here is a heated observation from a solar
panel
supplier about the figures given in the <span class="small-caps">RICS</span> <span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>The Greener Homes Price
Guide&rsquo;:</p><p>Jeremy Leggett, Executive Chairman, Solarcentury (a <span class="small-caps">PV</span> and solar
panel supplier and installer) says:</p><blockquote><p><span class="pull-double">&ldquo;</span>How <span class="small-caps">RICS</span> (The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors) got it wrong</p><p>To use an example, a typical domestic retrofit system saves over
a tonne of <span class="small-caps">CO</span><sub>2</sub> per year and &pound;350 per year off electricity
bills at
today&apos;s prices. The system is warranted for another 20 years and will
last another 20 years beyond that. Right now, solar installers are
offering retrofit <span class="small-caps">PV</span> systems with a<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>payback” of 13 years, not the 100
years quoted by <span class="small-caps">RICS</span>. That figure will drop further with future
electricity inflation and falling solar <span class="small-caps">PV</span> costs. In addition, the
Government&apos;s grant programme offers guaranteed domestic <span class="small-caps">PV</span> grants of up
to &pound;2,500 till mid-2010 towards the cost of installation [see <a href="http://www.lowcarbonbuildings.co.uk/">www.lowcarbonbuildings.co.uk</a>.]
For solar hot water, the <span class="small-caps">RICS</span> research assumption peddled as<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>fact” of
annual energy savings of just &pound;24 and a 208 year<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>payback” is simply
incorrect.</p><p>Only this week, the many micro-generating customers of Scottish
and
Southern Energy received the news that from 1st September they will be
paid 20p per unit for their exported electricity. This means that the
typical <span class="small-caps">UK</span> domestic <span class="small-caps">PV</span> owner will be saving well over &pound;350 per year on
their electricity bills at today&apos;s prices. On this basis, a typical
domestic <span class="small-caps">PV</span> system will pay back in about 13 years. On top of that the
value of their property will have increased as a result of their
decision to install <span class="small-caps">PV</span>.</p><p>Additionally, the supposed 30 year working lifetime of
photovoltaics is
very much an underestimate. Some of the first solar panels manufactured
by Sharp and installed in Japan over 40 years ago are still generating
electricity today. And that&apos;s using half century old technology. Just
because a solar panel has a warranty of 25 years doesn&apos;t mean that
should be taken as an indication of its lifetime. Nobody would expect
their fridge to pack up after two or three years, just because that&apos;s
the warranty period. For that matter, you wouldn&apos;t talk about payback
when investing in a fridge either.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>So conflicting views&nbsp;&ndash; but I do very much take the point that
just
because guarantees are being offered say for twenty years this does not
mean the system will not last for forty years (the inverter
excepted)&nbsp;&ndash;
that is forty years of carbon savings and forty years of financial
payback (see below re. <a href="#mozTocId670558">calculations for financial payback</a>).</p><p>So how do we form an independent view on this? Everything of
course is about the cost of electricity now and in the future&nbsp;-
there
is little doubt that the cost of <span class="small-caps">PV</span> installations will reduce with the
economy of size and has already done so in Germany.</p><p>There has been a real commitment to this technology in Germany. </p><h2 id="mozTocId373733">Relationship between
Oil, Gas and Electricity in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and Europe</h2><p>It is helpful to try to understand if there is a relationship
between oil, gas and electricity prices now and in the future.</p><p>Are electricity costs going to go up and by how much in the next 20
years?<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>How long is a piece of string&rsquo; may be the answer but at least
an attempt to answer this question should be made.</p><p>David Shaw of Efficiency Direct wrote an interesting article in
February 2007 discussing this very issue. In his article<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>How oil
prices affect utility costs&rsquo;, he looks at
the historic link and the situation today.</p><p>It is explained historically both in Europe and the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> that the
price of oil has been linked with the price of gas and because a large
proportion of the <span class="small-caps">UK</span><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&rsquo;</span>s electricity is generated from gas, any large
movement of oil prices will affect both retail gas and electricity
prices.</p><p>The question then is what affects oil prices which Dave Shaw says in
his article is<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>very complex and multi&ndash;dimensional&rsquo;.</p><p>However from what I can see once the world economy is back on its
feet again it can only go one way and that is up&nbsp;- and as
described by
the Chief Executive of Gazprom to $250 per barrel at some time in the
future and this price rise would be in line with any resource that is
running out fast&nbsp;- or has reached its<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>plateau&rsquo;.</p><h4 id="mozTocId670558">Returning to Payback
of Photovoltaics (<span class="small-caps">PV</span>)</h4><p>So why are the predictions made for <span class="small-caps">PV</span> for financial payback so all
over the place?</p><p>Jeremy Leggett of Solarcentury is predicting 13 years in a specific
case and The Greener Homes Price Guide do not give a specific figure
but by inference of annual energy savings is 100 years or more and the
Energy Savings Trust somewhere in between depending on which of their
examples you pick.</p><p>I want to try to pin this down as accurately as I can, of course
there are many variables&nbsp;- one thing we do know is the solar
irradiation of the sun varies throughout the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> but not that much.</p><p>There does seem to be a consensus that the carbon payback is pretty
quick but we will look at that as well.</p><p>A very readable and comprehensive 132 page final technical report on
domestic photovoltaic field trials in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> between 2000 and 2005 was
first published in 2006 and may be read at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36660.pdf">www.berr.gov.uk/files/file36660.pdf</a>.</p><p>The trials were carried out under contract as part of the Department
of Trade and Industry (now <span class="small-caps">BERR</span>) New and Renewable Energy Programme and
the report is a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>must read&rsquo; for potential <span class="small-caps">PV</span> installers if only to
avoid the installation pitfalls.</p><p>The report details the trials on 28 different projects installing
photovoltaics in different locations in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span>.</p><p>The Executive Summary concluded that based on a lifetime of 25
years (much disputed as too short a lifetime by Jeremy Leggett of
Solarcentury&nbsp;&ndash; <a href="#mozTocId976030">see above</a>) the cost of <span class="small-caps">PV</span> generated was
found to be
between 20.9p/kWh and 184.7p/kWh with an average of 47.5p/kWh.</p><p>(No surprises here for readers of this article at the extraordinary
variations in results&nbsp;&ndash; but in fairness I should mention that
the
trials are inclusive of both installations to new buildings as well as
retrofit to existing buildings&nbsp;&ndash; the latter of which are more
expensive
to install.)</p><p>The report also goes on to state that if the known underperforming
panels are removed the average and maximum costs are 39.1p/kWh and
77.8p/kWh respectively.</p><p>The report states that this is significantly better than the
average generally quoted of 50p/kWh.</p><p>Although the above is helpful what we want is a guide on how to
calculate independently both financial and carbon payback for a PV
system added to an individual property.</p><p>Help is at hand if the form the calculator at: <a href="http://www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php">www.encraft.co.uk/ws/P/Calculators/HomePage.php</a>.</p><p>At this site it is possible to feed in your post code and rates for
electricity and an approximation of both financial payback and carbon
payback is made by the calculator.</p><p>The default post code is <span class="small-caps">NG1</span> <span class="small-caps">6BJ</span> and based on a target annual
generation of 1,000 kWh per year.</p><p>The example given is for a 1.2 kWp grid connected photovoltaic
modules system requiring 9.8 square metres of roof space. The design
tool assumes the modules are made from crystalline silicon with a
conversion efficiency of 12%.</p><p>A budget cost for the installation is assumed to be &pound;7,400 and with
a grant of &pound;2,400 an actual cost of &pound;5,000.</p><p>Given the default assumptions of the price of electricity the
financial payback is calculated at 25.1 years and the carbon payback at
3.2 years.</p><p>If I put in my own post code the equivalent figures are
23.9 years and 3.0 years because of the slight increase in solar
irradiation in Sussex.</p><p>What the calculator does not seem to have provision for at the
moment (and I have spoken to Encraft and their proposal is to put in
various electricity supplier rates in the future) is for a rate which
included payments for all electricity generated.</p><p>At the moment (summer 2009) Good Energy are paying 15p/kWh for
energy<em>generated</em> rather than exported to the grid. (The value of
Renewable Obligation Certifiates are
included in this figure).</p><p>A simple calculation tells me for post code <span class="small-caps">NG1</span> <span class="small-caps">6BJ</span> if I put the Renewable Obligation Certifiate
values at nil, the payback through saving of electricity will be &pound;109
(this assumes only 70% use of the electricity). However 1,000kWh at 15p
per hour will add &pound;150 to this figure making a saving of &pound;259 and a
financial payback period of 19.3 years.</p><p>As previously stated according to the Department for <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/">Business
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform</a> website, the<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Government
is committed to having FITs in place in April 2010&rsquo;.</p><p>FITs or Feed in Tariffs could just light the blue touch paper for
the solar <span class="small-caps">PV</span> industry in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> and this has already happened in
Germany so that solar <span class="small-caps">PV</span> is now a major contributor to German
electricity generation &ndash; solar irradiation levels are not that
dissimilar in the <span class="small-caps">UK</span> from Germany&nbsp;&ndash; see the <a href="http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/">Joint Research Centre</a> site
for solar irradiation levels in Europe.</p><p>Using a Feed in Tariff system electricity companies are obliged by
Governments to buy renewable electricity at above market rates.</p><p>In this way the solar <span class="small-caps">PV</span> owner will receive a fixed payment for
generated electricity for a fixed period of time say 20 years.</p><p>So in our example if FITs were set at 40p then the figures would be
a payback of &pound;109&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,000kWh
generated&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;40p&nbsp;=&nbsp;&pound;509.</p><p>A payback of just 9.8 years.</p><p>But it is quite likely the grant of &pound;2,400 would be withdrawn in
which case the figure would have to be revised to 14.5 years.</p><p>It is quite possible, but there are no guarantees, that
installations now and in the past will also benefit from the new FITs
and this is therefore a good argument for having the work done now
whilst the grants are still in place.</p><p>When the <span class="small-caps">FIT</span> figures are set in April 2010 then the above example, of
course, will need to be replaced with the actual figures and this we
will do in this article.</p><p>Germany, France, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy,
Netherlands, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Belgium, Slovenia and Slovakia all use long term feed in
tariffs.</p><p>I have to confess to a feeling of surprise&nbsp;&ndash; everywhere I read
that
solar <span class="small-caps">PV</span> is just too long term to be financially viable and also
uninformed observations that <span class="small-caps">UK</span> does not have enough<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>sun&rsquo;&nbsp;- it
has
reasonably similar irradiance levels to Germany&nbsp;&ndash; and for the
story so
far in Germany please see this Guardian article, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/jul/23/germany.greenbusiness"><span class="push-single"></span><span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>Germany sets shining example in providing a harvest for the world&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>What is not factored in to any of the figures is the electricity
prices if and when (probably when) oil prices reach $250 per barrel.</p><h3 id="mozTocId769718">Fuel cells for the
Future</h3><p>Fuel cells are electrochemical devices and are being developed for
heating and electricity for homes. They use hydrogen and oxygen
through a membrane to produce electricity and heat; when it combusts it
produces nothing but water.</p><p>If a hydrogen pipework infrastructure existed the system would be
ideal for piping hydrogen to homes to use this technology&nbsp;&ndash;
unfortunately, of course, it does not.</p><p>The alternative then is to use the natural gas infrastructure
that already exists.</p><p>The German company Baxi Innotech have developed a fuel cell using
natural gas which is converted to a hydrogen rich gas, and state that
they
have 800 units in operation in Europe.</p><p>The fuel cell which is about the size of a fridge is capable of
producing 1.5kW of electricity and 3 kW of heat.</p><p>Baxi tell me they are expected to be available to home owners from
2010 and Vaillant expect their own fuel cell unit to be available in
the market in 2010. It is anticipated that they will operate in
conjunction with condensing boilers to provide the additional heat.</p><p>This development could well be a long term solution for domestic
markets&nbsp;&ndash; better still if a hydrogen infrastructure is installed
although this does not seem likely.</p><h2 id="mozTocId357889"><span class="small-caps">UK</span> Grants</h2><p>At April 2009:</p><h3 id="mozTocId745022">Domestic <span class="small-caps">UK</span> Grants</h3><p>The grants for microgeneration technologies for England and Wales

see <a href="http://www.lowcarbonbuildingsphase2.org.uk/filelibrary/LCBP2E/LCBP2_FAQ_new_v1.0.pdf">www.lowcarbonbuildingphase2.org</a>.</p><p>The site goes on to explain the Framework Suppliers are required to
use a person, firm or company specified as certificated installers in
relation to the relevant technology.</p><p>The Framework Suppliers appear to be an extremely limited list and
are: British Gas, Dimplex, E.ON <span class="small-caps">UK</span>, The Low Carbon Partnership, RES
Heat
and Power, Solarcentury, and Solar Microgeneration.</p><p>Some are stated to be suppliers for say only solar photovoltaics and
some for several methods of microgeneration&nbsp;&ndash; so this limits the
list
even more.</p><p>When I queried the limited tendering procedure and, in particular,
the omission of air source heat pumps this is the reply I received from
the Building Research Establishment (<span class="small-caps">BRE</span>):</p><blockquote><p>Dear Mike,</p><p>Thank you for leaving the above feedback on our website. </p><p>Seven Framework Suppliers were chosen by <span class="small-caps">BERR</span> following a
competitive
tender to ensure quality, range and value for money. The contract
notices for the Framework Suppliers were published at the Official
Journal of the European Union (<span class="small-caps">OJEU</span>) in June 2006 (for a web link please see the <span class="small-caps">FAQ</span> document on our website). The deadline for expressions of
interest has now passed. <span class="small-caps">BERR</span> are not considering any more tenders.
Framework Suppliers are required to use certificated installers in
relation to the relevant technology. Installers need to contact the
framework suppliers directly for more detail on becoming listed as
one
of their installers.</p><p>Unfortunately there were insufficient expressions of interest from
the
framework suppliers during the tender process to enable inclusion of
all
Microgeneration technologies in the final framework, air source heat
pumps were one of these. There is a set product list available to
download from the website that must be used in order to be eligible
for a grant.</p><p>The above information can be found in the FAQs on our website,
please
also see guidance notes and terms and conditions.</p><p>I hope this has answered your queries however please let me know
if
you require any further information.</p><p>Kind Regards,<br>Administrator, Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 2<br><span class="small-caps">BRE</span></p></blockquote><p>I wrote again to ask if it was likely that grants for heat pumps for
Public Buildings was likely to change in the future and this is the
response:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Mike,</p><p>We do not know of any grants for air source heat pumps available
to
the public sector at the moment.
Phase 1 of the <span class="small-caps">LCBP</span> does cover air source heat pumps&nbsp;- however
this
is
now only open to domestic homeowners.</p><p>We do not know what future schemes may be opened up in the future,
or
what technologies these may cover. Any updates will be posted on the
LCBP Phase 2 website homepage.</p><p>Sorry I cannot be of anymore assistance.</p><p>Kind Regards,<br>Administrator, Low Carbon Buildings Programme Phase 2<br><span class="small-caps">BRE</span></p></blockquote><p>So <span class="small-caps">EU</span> best practices for tendering may have been followed but an
entire industry has been left out for grants in the public sector due
to
lack of interest it seems&nbsp;&ndash; this clearly does not make sense and
must
be a reflection on the method of procuring tenders no matter how
correctly the <span class="small-caps">EU</span> tendering procedure has been observed.</p><p>See <a href="#mozTocId316994">Heat Pumps</a> for discussion of the application and importance of
air source heat pumps and in particular <a href="#energy_comparison_chart">this diagram</a>.</p><h3 id="mozTocId168749">Grants for Private

sustainable energy. This hugely important book fills that gap both
technically and highly readably. It should be a<span class="push-single"></span> <span class="pull-single">&lsquo;</span>must read&rsquo; not only at
